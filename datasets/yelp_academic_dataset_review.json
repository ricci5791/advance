You know you're at home, but someone's moved something, rearranged the furniture, or otherwise changed things ever so slightly but just enough to make you suspicious. This wasn't the Epicure Cafe that I remember from three or four years ago.\n\nI learned from Jackie, our cutesy server who was a total dupe for actress Clea DuVall, that a few years ago Epicure changed locations. To a few doors down farther east on Queen, on the same side of the street. Which explains the slightly-different-but-not-quite layout, decor and seating. It was a pleasant surprise. I didn't venture upstairs but I was told there's an outdoor eating area that will have to be explored on my next visit.\n\nThe menu options are, like others have said, a bit overwhelming. But for the fussy eater (I was with one of them) there was no lack of choice - Epicure has everything from pasta (17 choices, including different sauces and shapes), burgers, pizza, wraps and another full page of duck/veal/lamb/chicken options. I appreciate the selection but it could stand to be honed a little! Luckily Jackie was able to recommend favourites when we showed indecision. \n\nMy eyes went straight for the Pumpkin Ravioi ($14), which I was assured was \"not a mistake\". And it wasn't. I barely looked up my from my plate as I feasted my eyes on the glorious, pillowy ravioli on my plate. They were seasoned with ginger and nutmeg, tossed in parmesan cream sauce with grilled corn, wilted spinach and mushrooms. The mushrooms were perfectly sauteed, the spinach was wilted just right and the corn was fresh and added the exact amount of crunch that the dish needed. The portion wasn't skimpy either - at some restaurants when you order jumbo ravioli you get 3-4 pieces, but this was more than double the size. Good value for the money.\n\nI was more than tempted by the dessert board (tartufo, ice cream, tiramisu, Grand Marnier cheesecake or cr√®me caramel, Belgian chocolate mousse, apple crumble) but unfortunately dinner left me positively STUFFED. After seeing that Epicure is now open until 1 or 2am every night I know where I'll be heading for late night dessert!","useful":6}

It had a nice balance of thin sliced meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and tangy red wine vinegar in between two perfectly grilled pieces of bread.  The thin crust pizzas are pretty decent also.

So last night, after a quick shopping stop at the Crafeteria event hosted by Frances, we headed over to Otro Cafe for dinner.  We were not disappointed!\n\nI used the Yelp app directions to find the location (duh!), and were psyched to find plenty of parking + no wait to sit down when we arrived without a reservation around 8pm on a Friday.  All of the employees that we encountered were extremely friendly and personable from the hostess and our server to Heather, another staff member that we recognized from another local cafe.  \n\nOur server, Randy was attentive and offered recs on the menu when we asked.  We ended up sharing an order of the Guacamole Classico as an app.  I ordered it with both chips and raw veggies.  I love that the veggies are an option.  (Veggies are chilled just right and include carrots, celery, cucumbers, jicama and radish).   The guac is chunky and includes avocado, cilantro, serrano chiles, lime juice, salt, white onions, tomatillos, orange and cotija cheese.  We each had a beer from their selection of both Mexican and local options, and then shared two entrees: the Pescado del Dia and the Mole Negro.  The fish came with veggies and the mole chicken came with fried rice and tortillas.  \n\nThe ambiance is casual and features art on the wall from local artists.  The prices are moderate, especially considering portion sizes.  There is something for everyone on the menu too... and it's worth noting that Otro opens on Saturdays and Sundays at 8am for breakfast.  They get their coffee from Lux as well!\n\nWe'll definitely be back to Otro, and hopefully pronto!","useful":9}

The food menu was also decent with ample vegetarian options (black bean burrito, veg burger, mac &amp; cheese, veg poutine and more) and fun-sounding specials. The specials menu was printed on a white sheet of paper with individual \"SOLD OUT\" stamps on the items no longer available. Cute!\n\nI asked our vegetarian server for recommendations and she strongly urged me to order the veggie burger, and I'm so glad I did. I upgraded my side to a poutine ($3 vs $5.95 for a regular size) and it was still almost too big for one person. I was not the biggest fan of the fries -- sort of thin and crisp like McCain frozen fries -- I expect poutine fries to be more like New York Fries. More rustic. But the cheese and veg gravy made up for it as they were both oozing with lipids and general unhealthiness. \n\nThe veggie burger was enormous and could barely be contained on the bun itself.

I was struck by the  usual panic that I'm sure my friends have grown tired of wherein I scream \"OMG I AM EATING MEAT!

My nails LOOKED fabulous and I got heaps of compliments & questions about them: http://twitpic.com/1c0yla\n\nFirst thing's first: Heartbreaker is located next door to, and owned by the same folks, as Barberella - an excellent hair salon run by Tara Leigh, who is fabulous at cutting hair. Many of my friends swear by her. I had high expectations for Heartbreaker after hearing that they're the only salon in Toronto that offers Minx Nails (http://www.minxnails.com). Beyonce and Rihanna have these nails, ergo, *I* should have these nails.\n\nAs those who've read my mani reviews before (full list here: http://www.yelp.ca/list/best-nail-salons-in-toronto-toronto), I never review a manicure until it's worn off so I can report on the duration and quality of the polish application.\n\nI know you must be saying to yourself, \"But Kat, I thought you only got this mani a few days ago, on Thursday? It's only Tuesday and you're already reviewing it?\"\n\nYes, yes I am. In fact, the mani lasted till Saturday. At $45 ($20 for a regular mani, plus $25 for the Minx part), that's nearly a dollar per hour that it lasted. Not a good value and I can't afford to get this again. \n\nSo, Minx is a solid film with an adhesive back that is heat activated (ie a sticker). It's fitted to your nail size and what's cool is that there's a book of patterns available, like stripes, paisley, plaid, houndstooth, etc. You can mix and match as you please, but if they don't have a thumbnail adhesive left, you're not getting that pattern on your thumb. You can order custom out of stock adhesives within about a week. Unfortunately they didn't have enough of the adhesives that I wanted for a full set so I mix and matched.\n\nAccording to Minx's website, \"when properly applied, the mani should last 1-2 weeks. Minx does not chip, but it may wear slightly at the free edge of the nails that are heavily used but will not wear any further.\"\n\nCUTICLE WORK/MISHAPS:\nA set of new tools was opened and used. I had grown my nails fairly long not knowing what was needed, and asked to have them filed 'square' but the result was oval (?). Cuticle work was brief - very average.\n\nHAND MASSAGE:\nOn a scale of 1 to \"Are you there God, it's me, Margaret?\" I'd say it was a 4. My eyes did not involuntarily close - they didn't have time to.\n\nPOLISH APPLICATION:\nN/A as it is an applied sticker in the case of a Minx mani. In order to get the Minx to adhere, you place your hands under a heat lamp that generates a wattage of between 175 and 250w. The lamp was uncomfortably hot even at a distance and I had to constantly keep my hands moving or take breaks because the lamp was too hot (to the lack of observation by the manicurist). \n\nPOLISH DURATION:\nHere's where I get pissy. Imagine ripping a nail and the rough edge that results - this is how all ten of your nails feel after a Minx mani. It was such a weird feeling; I couldn't get used to it. They kept snagging on things and I'm pretty sure this was due to the ill preparation of the nail bed or something, because I doubt Beyonce and Rihanna put up with their nails snagging on their sweaters. Even if it had lasted longer than 48 hours I would have peeled off the stickers before that point out of annoyance. On Friday a few of the adhesives started lifting off at the edge and I had to constantly press down on them so they would stay on. By Sunday most of the nails were lifting off, except for the silver ring finger adhesive, which is actually still going. Either I picked a pattern that doesn't stay on well or she didn't apply them properly. That night I peeled off the adhesives altogether without doing any damage to my nails, thankfully.\n\nEXTRA NOTES:\nThe salon was very beautiful and clean. The staff was welcoming and I loved the decor. The music (Camper Van Beethoven, The Sugarcubes, No Doubt) was also great. \n\nIf this is what the typical $20 mani entails, I found it to be subpar compared to the salons I've frequented that give manis at half the price. I glanced at the polish selection and it seemed to mostly be Orly - not sure if I saw any OPI, Essie or China Glaze. If I could buy the Minx adhesives directly from the manufacturer (you can't yet) I would try this at home but I would not pay $45 for this again.","useful":15}

I checked out their website and saw that they update it weekly to post their daily specials too.\n\nI'm finishing up my coffee and feeling a nice caffeine buzz as I type this review.  If you're in the area of the Galleria building in Old Town, go check out Cafe Conmigo and say hello to Nancy.  They are open Monday - Friday from 7:30am until 3:00pm.\n\n***Oh, and the best part of all? My coffee with steamed soy milk was cheaper than at Starbucks!","useful":14}

I tasted ginger with the mushrooms, which is a good thing if you're like me and like ginger!  I love the concept of the soft noodles with a fried egg on top - everything is better with an egg on it!  This dish was lacking a bit of zing, but we added hot chile sauce to it and that did the trick.  The shrimp was tasty but similar to every other \"shrimp in lobster sauce\" dish I've had in the past.\n\nThe one thing I'd like to see added to SMPP's menu is eggplant; I'm a huge eggplant fan and order it pretty much where ever I go!

Since then, we have returned a few times with other guests on the way to one of our favorite hiking spots.  \n\nMy friend first told us he was taking us to the \"demented animal farm\".  He said that this place takes in all types of animals, including ones that have been injured or abandoned in the desert over the years.  We are talking everyting from deer, hogs and wolves to exotic animals like the Australian Lynx.  They even have a peacock.\n\nWhen we arrived, we found that Bonnie Springs was a lot more than a shelter for discarded animals.  There was an old western town, a train, a small motel, a pond with ducks, and a restaurant.  All of that on top of a large (and growing) section of animals.  What makes this especially funny/interesting is that this place is literally in the middle of nowhere!\n\nThe animals are my favorite.  Not only is this a free attraction, but you get to pet and feed many of the animals.  Many are in cages or are fenced in, but some are just wandering freely.  One deer, in particular, ate food from my hand as he stood next to me in the corridor.  I would say that this place is safe for children, but know in advance that this is not like a zoo.  Closed-toe shoes are recommended as the ground is rocky and uneven.  I did not see any \"demented animals\" but there are a few that have obviously had some trauma.  I always donate a few dollars.  Everytime I return, the place is larger and there are more animals.\n\nThe old western town is interesting.  Apparently, they have shows on certain days, but it was like a ghost town the last time I went.  We had one funny thing happen here.  We went into the candy store to look around.  My nephew wanted a chocolate bar.  As he was getting one from the shelf, I saw a small mouse run across the floor.  I didn't say anything.  When we got outside and he opened his milk chocolate bar, we were all horrified to find it was completely white!  Have you even seen brown chocolate turn white?  I told my nephew to keep it as it may be an artifact.\n\nOverall, this place is a trip.  Truly worth a quick visit if you are passing through, but I wouldn't plan a day around it.\"","useful":2}

There are often lots of bikers and folks hanging out in the covered shelters.  In the winter there are often lots of ice fishers hanging out on the Bay.  \n\nIn terms of on-leash excitement, it's basically a \"from here to there\" sort of a path.  It is nice to be able to sit in the park, on a bench, have a picnic, look at the Capitol, and have your pup with you.  It's not a park for seriously long walks as it's simply too small.

There is not parking at this area, you will need to park at least a block away either finding street parking in the neighborhood or seeking a spot in a lot off of N Shore Dr.  The off leash area is pretty small compared to some of the others, but this is not always bad because it makes losing your dog much harder.  :)  At 7pm on a Tuesday there were plenty of folks coming and going; at a minimum there were two dogs and we maxed out around seven.  Folks seemed to know eachother, you could tell there were a lot of regulars here.  One con is that there is no water spigot in the area, you have to walk beyond the tennis courts to fill up for the thirsty pooches.  One pro is that people tend to mingle more than other dog parks.  There's no path to walk on so there's a lot more standing around and chatting.

Most of the $20/ day trucks and minivans are only within town moves. Put in a credit card and info and you pay when you pick up. Most of the rentals (out of town) are calculated for 4 days. In fact, the only way I think you can do daily is within town. Bam, the amount quoted (brought the printout just in case) was put on the card and away we go.\n\nSo I go to pick up the truck with some harsh reminders on Sahara. A lot of the auto dealerships are now empty lots with realtor signage and weeds growing from cracks in the cement. Empty stores remain vacant. A Chili's (where my g/f once saw Flava Flav) building days ago had been leveled and was a lot full of rubble and rebar. A Red Robin is now a Habib's. Funny how the national places close, only to be replaced by smaller ethnic businesses, which in turn become larger if they can survive til the market goes back up. I have to support the smaller, local businesses. Still better than strip malls I've seen vacant in Vegas for longer than the past 4 years when Vegas was still \"booming.\" \n\nI pull into the lot and there are a group of guys standing around whistling, trying to get my attention. Day laborers. U-Hauls bring out my best *sarcasm* since I want to pick up the truck when they open to get my full days worth, at 7:00AM. So I'm waiting for a bit for them to set up inside. There's already A U-Haul guy from the garage part walking around the front lot. What I notice on the front door is they have a chart with some guys names and rates, mostly around $15/ hour. These are the guys standing there across the street in the abandoned auto dealership. I think it's cool that they at least register, so they appear to be legally paid, it covers them and U-Haul and us, I suppose. The next time I went, I saw an employee walk out across the street to distribute what looked to be paychecks or stubs or something. \n\nDo my paper work inside, the people are friendly enough for that time of the morning, I was holding back sore muscle insomnia crankiness myself. I never understand boxes that U-Haul and Public storage (there's another review I have to do) sell. I went around, originally looking at Auto Zone, where I scored Oil boxes before. But I made a major haul at the huge aqua colored recycling bin at Lee's Discount liquor (another review!). And if you use the plastic crates on the side as steps to get boxes, at least be respectful and put them back.\n\nSo the truck is parked out front, running* where they let you do a pre inspection. It's important to point out every dent and let them put an \"x\" sticker on it, or they'll blame you for damage when you return the truck. Check under the front where people run over things and the tire wells and the top corners for those attempting drive thru. She was cool about putting stickers on every little thing. And then you're off, they get you out of there pretty quick.\n\n*So I get home and take the key out of the ignition. Was I groggy or was there not a buzzing? I spent the day trying to load, but it was over 110 degree heat. So I slept the rest of the day and then waited for my g/f to get home so she could sit in the back of the truck and watch it while I loaded it. I couldn't move the truck. The battery was dead because the LIGHTS HAD BEEN ON ALL DAY. The attendant put the lights on and didn't tell me. And I didn't know or think to turn them off. I had to sit in the open parking space next to the truck (and hold it, while answering all kinds of stupid questions from passersby) for my g/f to get home just to jump it. #FML! So check the lights when you get to your loading destination.","useful":3}

The service was fabulous thanks to the hostess that opened the door for us when we entered and exited, and of course thanks to Tony, our waiter.  The bathrooms were clean and although the atmosphere is a bit on the sterile side, I'd rather have that than a dirty restaurant!\n\nI went with the soup and salad - minestrone soup, and Farrah went with soup and salad - a creamy chicken and gnocci soup.  We also shared a mussels appetizer... I didn't love the breadsticks, and the mussels were a tad on the buttery side, but the soup and salad were both fresh and flavorful!  I had just one bowl of soup but several helpings of salad... and Tony didn't even flinch.  \n\nFarrah informed me that the Olive Garden chefs go to Italy for training and upon checking out their website, I see she is correct!  Here's what it says on their site: \"Olive Garden's Culinary Institute of Tuscany is located in the 11th century village of Riserva di Fizzano. Every year Olive Garden chefs travel to our Culinary Institute to learn authentic cooking secrets from Italian Chef Romana Neri and Chef Paolo Lafata.\"\n\nImpressive, huh?\n\nI still prefer to support local, but I have to say... I would have no qualms about returning to Olive Garden again!","useful":12}

When I discovered this via the distribution page, I promptly planned a trip to Montreal to stock up on these fine notebooks. OK fine - I wasn't *that* impulsive, but I did incorporate my burning yen for pale-lined graph paper notebooks into my trip plan.\n\nMontreal already has Essence Du Papier, which carries many, many brands of journals, agendas and fountain pens by reputable brands like Clairefontaine and Moleskine, but Nota Bene has so much more.\n\nFirst of all, the store is pristine and everything is wonderfully organized. There are so many goddman notebooks to choose from you won't be able to settle on just one. I was in such a tizzy over the availability of the notebooks that the owner could hardly contain her giggles. She was incredibly friendly and accommodating, and even alerted me to the fact that the store has an online shop and delivers to Toronto. The upstairs was being used as an art space when I visited. Cool idea.\n\nI ended up leaving with some Danish and German graph paper notebooks that were on sale for only $4 each, as well as some ink refills for my Lamy fountain pen and of course, the aforementioned Whitelines notebooks. I pretty much bought out the store. Trust me when I say these books are the BEST. The paper quality is unparalleled and it's such a treat to write on graph paper, without the distracting and harsh dark lines. The paper also photocopies or scans blank, meaning the lines disappear, giving the illusion of plain white paper.","useful":9}

The line wasn't bad but the staff there was extremely flustered.  \n\nThe guy that helped me asked me several times what I wanted and he clarified that they were out of romaine lettuce for the salads a few times.  I was fine with that; I actually like the shredded lettuce alternative; it's easier to eat!\n\nBefore it was my turn at the cash register, I noticed that the flustered employee admitted to putting the wrong cheese on another woman's salad and he had a conniption before throwing that one out and making a new one for her... he also forgot to prepare another customer's soup.  I thought this might just put him over the top, but he hung in there, at least to see me through the line!\n\nThe salad itself was edible, but not great... flustered guy did add olives, pepperocini, tomato, guacamole and egg per my request.  This was a good thing because the chicken in the salad was nasty... it tasted extremely processed and so did the guac although I ate that anyways.  I picked around chicken and used the honey mustard dressing for flavor.  The pita/lavosh that came with it wasn't bad.  Not the healthiest lunch, but it could've been much worse!\n\nSo there you have it, Quizno's at the airport is pretty average...

If the front desk person is rude or there is a long wait or something goes wrong with insurance or the bathroom is filthy, etc... these things all come into play.  But the bottom line when reviewing anything health/medical related really comes down to one thing: whether or not the service provided by the doctor is to your satisfaction.\n\nWithout going into too much detail, I recently went to see Dr. Klag at this office.  My first visit went smoothly and he prescribed a test and a follow up appointment.  I went for my test at another CVC office which was fine and then I returned to this office for my follow up with Dr. Klag.\n\nI will say that CVC does a great job at confirming appointments.  They have a service that does so and I appreciate the reminders.  However, it would be nice if someone could give some kind of warning when the doctor is running late.  20 minutes? fine. 30 minutes? not horrible.  an hour? please call me.  2 hours? are you kidding me?\n\nI checked in for my 11:10 am follow-up appointment a few minutes early - 11:05 to be precise.  I waited and waited and waited for my name to be called.  I struck up a conversation with a fellow around 11:50 that said he was still waiting for his 10:20 appointment.  At that point, I was really getting frustrated.  \n\nSure enough, I finally saw the doctor at 1:15  -  over two hours after my appointment time.  I was frustrated but relieved to learn that my heart is fine.  And even more relieved when I texted Jared and told him \"my heart is normal,\" and he responded with \"well... i promise not to break it.\"\n\nI really felt comfortable with Dr. Klag and would recommend him if you're in need of a cardiologist but just be warned, you may have to wait a bit!  And my advice to CVC - perhaps you can notify patients ahead of time if the doc is running behind schedule?!","useful":13}

Things were off to a great start!\n\nPaul, an Irish ex-pat with a love of Sinead O'Connor, strong aversion to all things Sinatra and an uncanny resemblance to Stephen Rea (of The Crying Game - also Irish!), took a good, long look at my hair situation, asked me what was on my mind and then took me to have my hair washed - truly the best part of any salon experience. \n\nParlour uses Kevin Murphy products, an Australian line of hair products made with natural ingredients, high grade essential oils and amino acids. All good stuff, and no yucky parabens or sulphates. I also had a hair treatment ($10) since my tresses had been under an extra amount of duress lately with all the hot tools I'd been subjecting them to.\n\nThe music in Parlour is old-timey and sexy - I glanced around a few times looking for a freakin' gramophone, because it was that crackly 1920s/1930s music that makes you wanna do 'jazz hands' and waltz with the nearest stranger.\n\nPaul cut and cut and cut. And razored and razored. He was meticulously precise about every movement and I appreciated his attention to detail.

I'd never had truffle oil or lobster in miso soup before, but I'm a fan of the combo!  Next up was an appetizer with spicy scallops and avocado on Pringles - yes Pringles potato chips.  A unique combo that definitely works!  Following that was a huge plate filled with sushi rolls:\nspicy tuna, california sunshine, shrimp tempura, and eye of the tiger.\n\nWe were so full after all of that, we had to turn down dessert.  Not sure when I'll be back to Cleveland, but when I am, I would not hesitate to return to Ginko.  I'm definitely a fan!","useful":5}

But this restaurant came up with an incredible prix fixe menu for Yelp Spring Break, and my party of six was blown away with the quality of our meal.\n\nOur waiter and the rest of the staff were attentive, although, if I recall correctly, it may have taken a while to get the bill.  Other than that, recommendations were awesome, drinks were always refilled before they went empty, service was prompt, etc... and I really enjoyed the environment of this restaurant as well; just feet away from the casino floor, yet not too loud that you can't carry on a conversation.  Our booth was comfortable as well.\n\nMy group chose a bottle of Terrazas Malbec from their plentiful wine selection, although the cocktails looked awesome too.  And before our first course, we requested Brand's infamous cast-iron baked dinner rolls, which were doughy heaven!\n\nThe best part of the experience, aside from the company, were the courses that followed.  Be forewarned though: portions are huge!  I had a wedge salad to start, the Chilean Sea Bass as my entree, and I shared sides with Katie B: the creamed spinach and the asparagus.  Everything was delicious!  I think I was in a food coma half way through my entree, but I managed to almost polish off my Baked Alaska dessert as well!\n\nOthers in our group were also pleased with their selections: Filet Mignon, Chicken, Tuna Tartare, and more.  \n\nTime to start watching my diet again now that Yelp Spring Break is over, but I'm sure I'll be ready to dine at Brand again next visit to Vegas.  It was a memorable meal for sure and I highly recommend a visit if you find yourself on the hunt for a steakhouse in Vegas!","useful":7}

Sure, it's expensive, but I've never had a bad meal (or drink) there.  But, I took an unintentional hiatus from Ocean Club when I got married and had a baby, and what do you know, at least two years have passed... \n\nSo when it was time to choose a restaurant to celebrate my mom's birthday dinner this past Saturday, Ocean Club it was, and once again, I was reminded how fabulous it is!  While I used to sit in the bar (where there is great people watching including plenty of \"hired help,\" awesome bartenders, and live music), we had the baby with us and a party of five, so we were seated in a back corner... this was totally fine by the way.  They had a highchair for the baby and everything!  \n\nTyler was our waiter and he was great... the rest of the staff was extremely attentive as well.  My husband, mom, and I went with dirty martinis, and my dad and brother went the bloody mary route.  We were all pleased with the drinks - as mentioned in other reviews, they are indeed pricey, but you get two drinks in one!\n\nBread bowl - this is worth mentioning as they always have a nice selection of breads and crackers including my favorite: pretzel bread... yum!\n\nAppetizers at our table included two types of oysters, a lobster sushi roll, salads, and calamari.  Hint: ask to split their salads - they are still a decent size when split.  I love their \"Ocean Club House salad\" - It could possibly be a meal in itself as it has crisp lettuce, fresh shrimp, egg, blue cheese, tomato, and onion.  The other apps were delicious too.\n\nFor my entree, I split the Chilean Sea Bass with my husband... I'm a huge sea bass fan and this is up with there with some of the best I've had.  Again, splitting it is great as even a half serving is plenty once you add family style sides, etc...  My parents went with lobster tail and brother had a bone-in ribeye.  We chose the roasted brussel sprouts and signature lobster mashed potatoes (both cooked perfectly and oh so delicious as well).  Note that it's very difficult to choose just a few sides as there are so many to choose from and they are all delicious.  The sweet potato fries, onion rings, creamed spinach, and steamed broccoli are other faves that I've had in the past.  \n\nAs if any of us weren't full enough, Tyler brought out a huge slice of chocolate cake for the birthday girl, served with fresh whipped cream.  Mmmmm.... and once we licked that plate clean, we also ordered their signature butter cake, which came with more fresh whipped cream.  OMG - that butter cake is incredible!\n\nWe all went home full and happy and will definitely return for more special occasions.  Thanks to my dad for picking up the bill!","useful":13}

An antique store sounded like the perfect way to find something unusual, so I Yelp'ed it and found a number of options.  I started my journey by heading to the Red Rooster Antique Mall (closing 7/15/10) when I stumbled upon the Charlston Antique Mall, which is just next door.\n\nAs I wandered through the place, I couldn't help but think about how similar it was to the San Francisco Antique Mall.  Basically, it is a large space with a series of small booths and rooms, provided by different antique vendors.  Definitely a fun place to walk around.\n\nA few things you might find include:\n\n1. Casino matchbooks, ash trays, dice, cards, soap bars, and memorabilia ($5+)\n2. Vintage video game systems by Sega and Coleco ($25-85)\n3. Chandeliers, paintings, furniture, and asian art ($50-250+)\n4. Star Wars items and other collectibles\n5. Yellow ostrich shoes (Size 13 men's)\n\nand so much more..\n\nThe people in the store were very friendly and asked if I needed assistance finding anything in particular.  Most of the people appered to be vendors working on their displays and what not, and they all seemed to be enjoying themselves and socializing.\n\nI did not find an excessive amount of Las Vegas memorabilia, which is what I was hoping to find, but they did have an amazing assortment of stuff (see photos).  Plan to spend at least an hour, because it will take that long to just walk through and glance at everything.\n\nPrices seemed high on some items and low on others.  That is likely the result of having many different vendors.  There are certainly some deals, depending on what you are looking for.  Don't be afraid to negotiate.","useful":1}

If you leave here hungry, the entire Ukrainian population will personally feel that it has failed you. Hunger is not an option. You must leave in a crippling state of fullness and discomfort, having eaten enough cabbage rolls and various deli meats to rival the quantity of food a championship sumo wrestler or Coney Island hot dog eating competitor would eat. \n\nOnce you announce that you're full and have had enough, another course will be brought to you, and so forth until you've eaten so much you have to be hoisted out of the place on a stretcher. That's just the way Ukrainians roll.\n\nSo here's the deal with Baby Point: they're caterers, and they do up pretty much every Ukrainian event in the city. If you've ever been to Ukrainian Festival, a Ukie wedding, baby shower, wedding shower, christening, etc., in Toronto I guarantee you've tasted the ambrosia that is Baby Point. In my family there hasn't been a single life milestone that hasn't been celebrated with a meal catered by Baby Point. One of my cousins has so many Ukie friends getting married, having kids, etc. that he eats here on a weekly basis, sometimes twice in one weekend.\n\nThe venue itself is often used for these events and you can come by any time to order food to go as they're always slaving away in the kitchen anyway and there are shit tons of leftovers. The venue is nothing to get excited about; it's like a church basement with minimal decor, big buffet tables and an errant step outside the washroom that you will trip over every time despite the caution sign.\n\nBut the food.\n\nMY LORD, THE FOOD!\n\nBorscht served in clear \"Polish\" mugs. \"Patychky\" (meat on a stick), Chicken Kyiv, \"Holubtsi\" (cabbage rolls), \"Pyrohy\" (pierogies), meat and cheese cannelloni, \"Nalesnyky\" (a type of sweet or savory crepe, but thicker than a regular one), and more.\n\nBut the real stars here are these two unforgettable, bite-sized babies:\n* \"Knyshi\" (I don't know how to say this in English): tiny little poppers of rice, gypsy meat that are breaded and deep-fried. I could eat 1000 of these.\n* \"Baraboli\": tiny Parisian style roast potatoes in ball format that are seasoned with rosemary and thyme and perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft inside. Again, I could eat 1000 of these. \n\nGorging is encouraged. \n\nThey also have a badass reputation for making gorgeous fruit salad sculptures shaped like peacocks and boars n' stuff (see pics).

Of course, I'm accidentally jacked up on a packet of 8 vitamins after forgetting I ingested a cappuccino. So my mind is some kinda Dexter Riley supercomputer for who knows how long. I have to type fast before my hands get too shaky or before I devolve to Algernon.\n\nI type this with the intention of reviews to be about traversing the Strip itself, Las Vegas Blvd.\n\nAs big an alcoholic as I am for the technically official Las Vegas- Downtown- I cannot deny the magnetism, charm and hopeful glory of the Strip. I'm not talking about any casino in particular but as a collective body of everything South of Russell Rd. to North downtown sign. The bold take it to Jerry's Nugget & the infamoustoric Palomino.\n\nMany, many times I have walked every foot of the Strip day and night, as a tourist and as a resident and employee- twice SNOWING, armed with a drink or on my first trip, the shameful walk with shopping bags on a mule run \"for back home.\" I've taken the Deuce, Monorail and Max buses, taxied and limoed Las Vegas, Blvd. and on one Parade Float I organized and chartered with 20 of my friends that made stretched Hum-V limos look like small, limp penises. I have been driven to parts unknown while drunk &/or hallucinating in friend's back seats. \n\nI have started drinking during sunset, partied all night and taken many, many many walks of shame, not only from sunrise, but as late as 10:00AM when the sun was spiking 80 degrees+. Try that starving with a hangover, with no form of any currency, and you earned your veteran badge.\n\nI bitch when I have to walk 2 miles now, but I worked on the Strip and lived on west Sahara and walked many nights over 8 miles to get home, because I LOVED the walk. I got so much thinking done. Recently I realized this was the Zen that I strive to create in my existence, now. \n\nYou see everyone in every walk of life people watching the Strip, from retirees to babies in strollers, people from every country of every color and accent, from die hard singles to married 70 years, sober to drunk, starving to full. The Strip is the intergalactic space station DS9 and Babylon 5 want to be.\n\nOnce I woke up drunk on the Strip trolley (when those ran) in front of Bellagio having no idea how I got on board. Of course the last thing I remembered was finishing a Warp Core Breach before going on and subsequently blacking out in the middle of the New Borg Encounter- with friends I had lost. And if you know the old Trolly route, you know it completed most of the strip \"clockwise\" to get to where I regained consciousness.\n\nOne of the best things you can do in Vegas is to cruise the strip on a motorcycle. First, it's RIG-G.D. DANGEROUS, so first and foremost, I would advise doing it after 2:00AM on a weeknight. Off season. I have been on many dates that involved cruising the Strip. And I'm not talking about just north and south, We'd get into cruising every side street, every valet loop, every employee and delivery access. \n\nIf there was a road that branched off the strip, I have taken it, just to see where each one went. I discovered many shortcuts and interesting access points that served me when my job became making deliveries along the Strip. Also I found shortcuts that a car could not fit in but a motorcycle could squeeze thru ;) in a pinch.\n\nAs a local, I have driven the Strip to the far ends of the galaxy north and as far south as Las Vegas Blvd. is actually paved and been to many ... outposts with inhabitants so odd, it qualifies me to be a stuntman. I also joke about my adventures on a couple of the spiral arms of the galaxy, northwest of the beltway or DJ massives I've been to east of Enterprise. And that military road going East into darkness...\n\nThe north takes you to a lonely branch of road called SR40, miles before Valley of Fire. Technology should someday reveal a lot of missing politicians, Union leaders, mobsters and desperate gamblers buried all along this route.\n\nThe south road is an interesting stretch that parallels a lot of Hwy 15 past Stateline. It winds up crossing underneath 15 where once I found part of a NHP sting that radioed to a partner on the Fwy. It took a lot of explaining as to why I was there. Since I wasn't satisfied, I went back weeks later and found the pavement stopped and became a dirt road that went to the west horizon of mountains. It was tough to drive on 2 wheels but I did slowly. I was intercepted by a, uh representative with a shotgun. I imagine satellite- infrared technology will also reveal a 5 mile radius of lost travelers buried in the area. And there must be a plant that grew from the 2 pounds of crap that was scared out of me that day. \n\nOh, I have stories, but I'm already running out of room. I already wrote about a few on my old blog.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to jog to Europe.","useful":3}

If my memory serves me correctly this may be the first off-leash dog park in Dane County.  It's not as big as Prairie Moraine, nor as hilly, but it is definitely a great park and has a nice variety of trails that take you through prairie and woods.  You know what that means... SHADE!!!  (Often in short supply at many of the dog parks).  \n\nThis park also offers quite a bit of water access with several small beaches along the river. It was busy, but not overly crowded by any means, on the random Sunday we visited.  The park is rather long and somewhat narrow but there seem to be about four trails that parallel each other heading north/south -- this is nice because if you're trying to avoid another dog (or they're trying to avoid you), there are options for that.  YES, THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO WANT TO AVOID LEO JUMPING ON THEM. There. I said it. GEEZ.   \n\nAnother nice feature here is that there are other hiking trails just off the same parking lot for dogs on-leash.  Finally, I think this is the first dog park we've been to where there is a HUMAN RESTROOM!  Indeed.  And a covered picnic area.  (Not directly in the on-leash area, that would just be asking for trouble).  \n\nAll in all, another great option about 20 minutes south of Madison - and a lovely drive past Lake Kegonsa to get there!","useful":3}

Yep, they're \"Montr√©al-style bagels\" so make sure you get some while you're in the city.  Here's the background: Fairmount is the original Montr√©al-style bagel.  The first shop opened in 1919 and several locations have since popped up around the city.  This location is the ORIGINAL original so go here.  Montr√©al-style bagels are slightly less fluffy than NY-style and they're a bit sweeter.  \n\nMy husband and I stopped in here for an onion bagel.  To be honest, the menu was pretty sparse.  Prices were available for singles, dozens, etc. but people have posted pics of sandwiches.  I'm not sure how to get said sandwiches or if there's a separate menu so that was confusing for a tourist like me, even one who speaks French.  They also didn't sell single-serve cream cheeses which was sad because we just wanted one bagel.  We bought one from here and one from St. Viateur for comparison purposes.  \n\nThis shop is small and there's tons of flour and other ingredients crowding the front area.  Everyone's working hard and if you come around 8 on a weekday morning there isn't much of a line.  Bagels were laid out and easy to select and one bagel was less than $2CAD.  We enjoyed what we ate but the onion topping was a little burnt tasting and the bagel was definitely super dry without some cream cheese (but we didn't want to buy a huge tub of the stuff for one bagel since we were roadtripping and had no where to keep it).  \n\nParking on the street is convenient but ends at 9 a.m. for loading purposes so watch your car.  I didn't see any other items on their menu (like coffee) so don't expect that when you visit.  All in all, a good experience, especially since this type of bagel is unique to the area.","useful":4}

There was a sandwich board blocking the entrance that declared \"Private party!\", but I don't really know how many stragglers would have attempted to bypass the board had it not been there. Luckily I was invited to said party so I had no trouble getting in. At 10pm I was one of ten people in the bar and I didn't know a single person - mercifully my friends arrived about half an hour later to save me from ogling those ten fine \"specimens\".\n\nMUSIC:\nThe music was a mix of Big Shiny Tunes 1-3 (literally) including really old songs by Soundgarden, Bush X, Green Day and Tea Party. The rest of the clientele, which consisted of 50 year old Filipino dudes, was totally into this music and there was a lot of generic grooving and head bopping. \n\nSERVERS:\nThe epitome of \"gussied up\". There were about eight girls working and they were dressed like they were waiting tables at Ultra or Century Room.\n\nDECOR:\nThink \"tryhard\" hotel bar/lounge. The last resort place to hang out when you're on an offsite business trip and realize you don't really want to venture too far from your bed - easier to just stumble back into bed at the end of the night. I kept looking for an elevator that would bring me upstairs to my room in the Econolodge.\n\nNot terrible but definitely forgettable, with the exception of what I think was the owner, who spent a large part of the evening walking around with an unlit cigarette in his mouth.","useful":5}

First of all, I'm lucky to live in a city that has a bike share program.  Some cities only offer the service to residents who pay annual fees, but the programs available for all are really wonderful.  Toronto's was no exception.  \n\nFor $7CAD (about $5.30USD) you have access to bikes for 30 minutes at a time for 24 hours.  There are TONS of stations all over the city so you shouldn't have a hard time finding a bike and a place to put it back.  We had a station about an eight minute walk from our Airbnb and then stations all over near places we were going (like the Royal Ontario Museum, Chinatown, etc.).  \n\nYou can also download the Toronto Transit App and see all bike stations (including how many bikes/empty spaces are available) and train and bus schedules.  You can also rent a bike (or a few for you and friends) through the app, which was my favorite feature!  You rent the bikes and then tell the app that you're ready to check one out and it gives you your codes.  \n\nToronto has pretty good bike lanes on major streets all over the city (not just close to downtown), which is more than Chicago can say.  I felt very safe riding these bikes and you don't need a helmet, which is convenient if you're an out-of-towner and don't carry one with you on vacation.\n\nAll of the bikes we saw were in good condition, tires were full, and the seats were easy to move up and down.

Long story...\n\nSo, I am in Arches National Park with my business partner and his 2-year-old son.  It is 112 degrees outside and we are hiking around and enjoying ourselves.  We were traveling in a camper.  After a day in the park, we decided to head out and on the way to our next destination.\n\nAbout 10 miles out of the park, we broke down.  The engine was seized!  No oil...oops.  This was especially bad since we were 2 hours away from the closest town with an auto mechanic, which happened to be Green River, Utah.\n\nWe called in a tow, which came after a couple of hours and we were off to Green River.  I drove our car behind the tow truck and my friend stayed in the camper with his son on top of the tow truck.  This would have been fine, but I could barely keep up with the speed demon in the 18-wheeler in our purple Dodge Neon rental car.\n\nWhen we finally got to Green River, it was bad news.  The mechanic with one tooth said, \"It's gonna take a while.\"  I swear it reminded me of the mechanics that ripped off Chevy Chase in National Lampoons Vacation.  After an evening of phone calls and begging for favors from friends, we decided to get another tow to a bigger town the next day.\n\nOnce the camper was in the right place and repairs had begun, we had to find a place to go for 10 days...how about Vegas?!  With a 2-year-old!  In a purple Neon!  Off we went.\n\nHas anybody tried staying in a Vegas hotel for 10 days?  With a 2-year-old?  Crap.  That was a challenge.  Try getting a bottle of milk from room service multiple times daily.  What do you think a hotel charges to wash a pair of socks for a 2-year-old?  Anyway, we drained our funds pretty quickly.  Especially since my business partner kept raiding the bank for gambling scratch.\n\nFinally, the phone call came from the guy fixing the camper.  It needed a new engine, new tires, new this, new that.  Blah!  The total for repairs was over $6K.  How much did we have left in our travel fund after 10 days in Vegas?  $1K.  Uh oh.  I know my friends wife wasn't going to be cool with us coming home late or without the camper.  What were we going to do?\n\nAlas, the El Cortez comes into the picture.  Since we were already screwed, I came up with the bright idea of going to the worst casino in Vegas with the last of our money and 'going for it'.  My business partner, who is good at Blackjack and has a huge set of huevos, said he was in.  We hired a babysitter who flew out from California (no joke) and headed downtown in the neon for a little action. We went straight to the El Cortez and parked in the lot on-site.\n\nAs we entered, the first thing I noticed was the exteme stench of cigarettes.  This place clearly didn't have a ventilation system.  We sat down at a Blackjack table and started playing.  Within an hour, my buddy was up a few thousand dollars and I was up about $500.  This was a great start, but we were not ready to leave.  As the pit bosses started moving the dealers around, we decided to get up and move with the dealer we liked.  This seemed to get some attention upstairs and we were being closely watched all of the sudden by pit bosses and a random person that came out from the back.  For this reason, I stopped playing and began walking around the place and having a few drinks.\n\nWhen I went back to check on my business partner, he was playing the table max bet and on a roll.  He had at least $8K in black chips in front of him so I grabbed $6K worth and went to cash it in.  No problem.\n\nAnother hour passes and he is still playing and still winning.  Now, he has a stack of black chips in front of him that totalled over $9K...and I have his other 6K in my pocket!!!  I told him we should leave and he agreed.\n\nThat was when we hit a little snag.  As soon as we got to the cage, they had people waiting there for us.  They said that we had to pay taxes on our cash because we had won over $10K.  Being drunk, I began to argue and told them that he owed me the money that I took from the table.  Technically, that was true since our money was pooled going in.  They hassled us for a while, but ultimately paid us in full and let us leave.  I will never forget running to the Neon in flip flops and cargo shorts, holding my pockets tight so the money wouldn't fly out.\n\nI love the El Cortez because of this night.  I will always love the El Cortez.  I carry matches from that night everywhere I go to this day.  They live in my briefcase.  During our big win, I remember asking the pit boss if we were going to get a room comped to us.  He said no.  I asked what the most expensive room in the hotel was running that night.  The answer was $19.95.  I guess we didn't play enough to warrant the comp.\n\nWe left and got the heck out of Vegas the next morning.  We picked up and paid for the camper repairs and his wife never found out that we even went to Vegas.","useful":8}

If not, you may need your napkin after that bite!\n\nAfter the greek salad phase, I took advantage of Zoe's 'dinners for four.'  I highly recommend the chicken kabob dinner.

It came with eight chicken kabobs, a huge container of rice pilaf, greek salad, and pita bread.  Great for a night that you don't want to cook!

That being said, our tSoynami definitely lived up to it's expectations... \n\nSince we wanted to share, the first step was agreeing on one of the 20+ flavors.  I didn't want anything chocolate based, and my husband is very particular, so this was quite a challenge.  I narrowed it down to Fluffernutterin, Chai Tiramisu, O', Soy Capitan, and Ginger Snap!  Jared chose the Chai Tiramisu from there.  \n\nMade from organic chai, organic animal crackers, soy whip and Nami's house-made organic soy based \"tsoft tserve\" ice cream, it was a hit, even considering the ten minute wait after we ordered.  (This is one popular spot!)  We finished the entire thing and agreed that it was $4.50 that was well worth it!\n\nI didn't realize that Nami also offers breakfast, coffee, and all kinds of vegan treats in addition to their famous tSoynamis.  Vegan or not, this place is worth a visit... and I'll look forward to returning soon.","useful":17}

We couldn't get a reservation since it was Restaurant Week, but we took our chances and found the perfect spot at the bar.  Natalie, the bartender / server was awesome... I'd go back again and again to hang with here at the beautiful bar if only it wasn't so pricey or if the food was deserving of the prices... not exactly the case.\n\nJared went for the three course Restaurant Week menu.  For $29, he had their house salad, a 7 oz filet, and sorbet for dessert.  I didn't find anything on that menu quite as appealing as the Chilean Sea Bass off the regular menu, so I splurged and went for that despite the $32 price tag.  I also ordered a side of steamed broccoli for $8.\n\nWe were offered fresh bread but declined it... our wedding is just a few weeks away, so no need for extra carbs!\n\nJared's salad came out pretty quickly and he shared a few bites with me - we were off to a good start - we cleaned the salad plate!  Next up, Jared's filet arrived with my side of broccoli.  The server who delivered it put both plates in front of Jared and said \"anything else I can get you?\"  We both answered at the same time \"just my (her) sea bass.\"  He then went to check on it.\n\nTen minutes later, my sea bass came out.  It looked good but when I went to cut into it, it was tough.  Now, I've had my fair share of sea bass - it's my favorite fish.  I've never had tough sea bass before.  Needless to say, we sent it back.\n\nJust as Jared finished his meal and we finished the broccoli together, the GM, Walter, came by to apologize.  He told us they were preparing a fresh piece of sea bass for me.\n\nWhen he asked if he could bring me anything else, I said sure... (I really wanted to try the glazed carrots).  It was awhile, but my new sea bass came out awhile later, as did the glazed carrots - and both were tasty.  Not amazing, but good.  Lucky for us, they ended up comping my sea bass and carrots.  \n\nJared's lemon sorbet was served after I finished up... it was a generous two scoops.\n\nSo, what would have cost around $100 on a typical night was half the price due to the *off* sea bass.  Would I do it again for full price?  Probably not... but if someone else is footing the bill, sure - I'll give OP another shot.","useful":13}

I ALWAYS recommended it to tourists when I was a concierge.\n\nIt's great for families, a lot of groups I see are Grandparents with their Grand kids. I usually get annoyed by kids yelling and screaming in public places, but this is mostly outdoors and kids are usually to happy to see the animals and wild, wild, west to scream.\n\nThe restaurant I'm told was built partially by the hands of Bonnie herself. One of the times we went, we actually got to meet her as she was having dinner at the bar. Off to the side you can see pictures of her when she performed as an ice skater and showgirl on the strip!\n\nThis is one of the stories you wish you could have. This is someone who has done something with her (and her husband's) money to not only preserve history, give a place for kids to go, shelter animals. Howard Hughes used to come in the restaurant and hang out. He's offered Bonnie several BLANK checks so he could acquire her ranch and the land. And bless Bonnie, she never budged. \n\nThe zoo has become a refuge for animals, obtained from zoos, strip performers like magicians. The sheriffs and BLM have been known to bring exotic animals that have been abandoned in the area that are too big/ unique to bring to the dog/ cat shelters in the valley. \n\nThere is always work to be done at Bonnie's. A lot of buildings need maintenance and refurbishing. We usually go to Bonnie's and spend a lot of money there, gladly, to help out. We go to the restaurant to celebrate something and go when we're starving. \n\nYou take all this in before you even get inside the restaurant. they used to have the menus printed on 5ths of alcoholic bottles: green bottles for breakfast (which I believe they still use). they changed the menu, so the lunch may not be on the clear bottles and dinner on the brown bottles anymore. \n\nOn Every table, you see a proclamation for Bonnie Levinson day every July. Her birthday is on the 31st, which to my disappointment, just found out about. (I write this aug 10th, I may still be able to go over there to wish her well).\n\nWe usually share an appetizer, last time it was potato skins. We've gotten beef sandwiches, bbq chicken. We can never seem to make it to desert. BUT, I do order Sarsparilla there, it's one of the few places that has it. It's one of the best sodas that I don't find in stores anymore.\n\nIn the winter, it does get cold out there. They have a fire pit by the entrance between the bar. On those occasions, we usually sit around it in the lounge chairs provided and sip a coffee drink, kahlua, bailey's, irish... They play country music which I enjoy. I used to think country sucked and was the music of depression, they always sing about losing a job, wife, dog, etc. But I even enjoy country and western music more because I associate it with this place. i've grown to appreciate it in general, part of it is vintage and a lot of songs are surprisingly topical and tell stories far better than pop/ rap/ hip hop music can. \n\nShe's been there since 1952 I believe. Bonnie springs is like a local Knott's berry farm, especially before it became a rides park. The restaurant is one of the most modern places at Bonnie Springs with cable tv at the bar, which is strange, but I suppose necessary for business. I don't believe the Saloon has TV's on, so that may be the most authentic watering hole on Property.\n\nI first went there for Halloween festivities. We even got a hotel room and went on the horseback ride the next morning. I even understand that George Carlin freaked out once and left the strip and stayed at one of the rooms to get away. Was it after the fallout with MGM? \n\nAll in all, excellent experiences every time we've gone. when you think of vintage Vegas in the 50's, the wild, wild west, and those postcards of the Grand Canyon when tourists used to dress up like cowboys, this is the place that maintains that classic experience.","useful":5}

I tend to buy unique pieces and jewellery only, and stick to cheaper stores for classic staples or fleeting trends. Some of the jewellery and accessories they have are stunning - really unique pieces\nthat you won't find anywhere else and they're usually nicely showcased on mannequins throughout the store. \n\nThe only downside to this location is that there are never enough cashes open and the lines are pretty long so I would recommend dragging someone (a work husband or otherwise platonic male friend will do) to the store with you and tasking them with waiting in line while you browse and gather all of your stuff.

And by standard, I mean this is what you will find at almost every Indian restaurant in America. I am no Genuine Indian food expert, but your average USA Indian restaurant will have the same menu as every other one, no matter what city or state you're in. \n\nThat being said, if that's what you're in the mood for, then FOI will fit the bill. It's in a very sad-looking strip mall, and the management of the restaurant must be very anxious about all of the empty storefronts around them. But the interior of the restaurant is spacious and comfortable, and when I walked in to pick up our takeout order, I was immediatelly greeted by a very friendly host. \n\nThe food was good, as far as overly-oily typical Indian fare goes. We ordered the Tandoori chicken, Tandoori fish, naan, and a cauliflower and potato dish. All were very tasty and served with basmati rice. \n\nI have two criticisms of the food:\n1)the onions in the tandoori dishes were raw. Perhaps if we had eaten there, they would have been served in a cast-iron skillet, which would have improved matters. I'll withhold final judgment until we try it again. The meats were all very good, though.\n\n2)OILY. Oh my goodness, there must have been equal parts oil and vegetables in the cauliflower dish. I wonder if Indian restaurants are under the impression that Americans really do want their food swimming in oil and that's why they make it that way, or if true Indian food, in India, is also as oily as what you'll find at restaurants here? I don't have the answer. \n\n**I will put in a plug here for Bombay Spice, at Tatum and Shea, which is Indian food made healthfully, without nearly as much oil or cream as most restaurants. I wish I could count on that everywhere. **\n\nSo, it was a solid 3-star experience, given that it met my expectations of very oily, very tasty average Indian food.

There are always a few hunched over dudes at the bar, watching sports or maybe counting their misfortunes.  One server appears to have always just had something weird or traumatic happen to her before she takes our order, like she was just bitching at SRP for shutting her power off or she just found out her teenage son got arrested on drug charges- then she comes to take our order.  While the service has never been despicable, we always have to wait an unnecessary amount of time for our tab, which sucks since we're anxious to get back to our meaningless jobs.\n\nShe also asks us \"what flavor\" of beer we want, which confused me since, like, Blue Moon is not exactly a \"flavor\" as much it is, you know, a brand.  But I can look past this.  \n\nI've eaten a few things here and the worst and most unacceptable was a simple dinner salad which was literally wilted Iceburg, bag lettuce with an obscene amount of dressing.  I can only assume that they thought if they covered the wilted lettuce with enough fatty Ranch I wouldn't notice the lettuce was bad.  I did, but I didn't send it back, instead I ate it and drank beer and talked about how much better the director's cut of Bladerunner is. \n\nThe wings are mediocre, not crispy enough for me to say they're cooked well, not thick enough to call them plump, and not tasty enough to assume that the sauce is anything more than some Frank's Red Hot concoction with some added butter or someshit.\n\nI've also had the pleasure of the chicken \"fritters\" which are, you know, frozen chicken strips deep fried.  I order these most times I come here because they can't really fuck it up and you can't exactly go wrong with chicken strips.  I've also ordered the \"fire\" fries which are just their fries with Cayenne pepper on them, and they charge another 1.50 for this. \n\nWhat IS worth the trip across the way and the shady, low brow atmosphere are the two dollar burgers on Tuesdays.  I actually never order the burgers only because I'm not much of a burger person, but my regular co-workers tell me they're tasty, a cut above a fast food burger and cheaper.  (Though, consider that you're also leaving a tip for the service, not getting fries, and paying extra for cheese, so it's not THAT much of a better deal than fast food, just sayin'.) \n\nWhat I can't look past, why Dirty Drummer is only getting two stars, is the fact that the only reason we came here; the five dollar pitchers of domestics, are now, for some reason, NINE dollar pitchers which, needles to say, is absolutely not worth it, especially considering the skimpy size of the pitchers, the depressing atmosphere and the tore up servers.

And thanks to the internet, I now have to worry about personal information and credit theft and automated, untraceable scams offering me more income if I \"spend a little money to make a lot of money.\"\n\nSo that leaves the past. We can always find things that were great before, especially before the \"big change.\" Even though locations have changed, I've always found San Gennaro's at least consistent in it's offerings every year I went. \n\nEvery year, I say I want to go to Clark County Fair. And every year, I had work, didn't have money, or didn't have a way to get out far north of town where it often is located. So in valley festivals became the staple I counted on. \n\nI saw San Gennaro's as where I literally feasted 1-2 times a year. I ate more here than I did on Thanksgiving and X-mas, 2 holidays I was used to working instead of celebrating. \n\nMost festivals have similar components that people complain about every year, yet I didn't see attendances decreasing any. In fact, I'd say it's easily one of the top 10 events of the year I talked with friends about going to. There are many things that cost a lot and yet we go once or twice a year to \"reward\" or \"indulge\" ourselves. \n\nMost of these things I understand. Vendor booths are for whoever wants to pay them for the most part. Those booths have things from the miracle seen on tv products to hot tubs, to things you don't know why they're being sold. Usually, we checked out all the booths and ate. \n\nAnd before leaving, if something passed all my mental reasoning we'd go back and check something out one more time. Booths bargain more at the end of the night/ festival. \n\nThe rides we know can be dangerous from the shoddy maintenance and wear, but we go on at least a few rides no matter how much the tickets are. And as a former ride mechanic, I have gone on rides, knowing there were \"extra parts\" still laying around the base of the ride. The scariest thing a man can see besides a kick in the crotch is a butter knife in a tool box. Dance with death.\n\nThere are a lot of things for kids to do, most cost money. The biggest moral dilemma I still think is neat is the live fish ping pong ball toss. It's cool kids can win fish as pets, they're simple(r) to take care of if they are healthy to begin with. As far as pets go, it's least traumatic when a goldfish passes away than a larger pet.\n\nMost importantly, out of most yearly events, I think there's an issue of safety that's taken for granted. The Feast is always well lit, there is adequate police presence. I never saw fights break out in the midway that decreased the popularity of my hometown fair. \n\nFood is more of a focus than alcohol and team rivalry, or music that fans believe they need to be on hallucinogens to enjoy. I believe those are the biggest factor of public nuisances. I believe a full belly keeps people happy and non combative.\n\nIt's why I always thought of San Gennaro's feast as one of the most consistent festivals year after year for families, everyone.","useful":1}

Not sure why it took me so long to write my own review, maybe because the 67 that came before mine do a pretty good job of describing it.  However, I woke up today and felt like giving my two cents - so here goes:\n\nWhether you go to Postino for a business lunch, an afternoon glass of wine, a happy hour, dinner, or even after dinner drink - you can't go wrong!  Postino is great for any occasion!  (Although maybe not a big group based on what I read in previous reviews).  \n\nI've been for pretty much all of the occasions listed above, and every visit to Postino, I leave a satisfied customer.  My favorite lunchtime menu items are the brushcetta (perfect for sharing as an appetizer and fun to choose from the variety of delicious selections), the Mixed Greens Salad (which comes with shaved pears, candied pecans, red grapes, gorgonzola, and crispy leeks served with poppyseed vinaigrette - and I usually add turkey to it too), and the Raspberry Chicken Salad.  LOL at my long description, but had to include it all!\n\nI'm not usually a daytime drinker but I'm all for starting happy hour early and taking advantage of 'wine by the glass' $4 special - great wine list! The ambiance and service is fantastic and it's fun to people watch at Postino as well.  It's a fantastic little neighborhood place, and there are several little details that make Postino stand out in my eyes... next time you're there, check out the sugar / sweet'n low dish thing on the table - there's a little something special there if you need to spit out your gum before digging into your meal :)  Also check out the branded rolls of TP in the bathroom - so cute!\n\nCan't wait to go on a Monday night sometime soon to take advantage of their special: $9 off a bottle of wine and pizza from LGO!  Postino has a regular loyal customer in me and I don't see that changing anytime soon!","useful":10}

So, unfortunately, the next few reviews may be bummers as I tried to get out of reviews being obits. \n\nThe reason why I review closed places is a reminder of what these places did right and out of all the businesses closing, why these were undeservedly so. And it's also to all those newer companies claim they use focus groups and test marketing when the results are things we apparently want, like the way we were fed brussel sprouts as children.\n\nLooking back, I think I rediscovered the refurbished Gold Spike (siegel version) after the downstairs caf√© closed at Binion's. It was a busy weekend downtown and I wanted to get away from the hubub while I nursed a drunk enough to start to remember the incidents of a few hours before. \n\nThe trap is they put such a delicious island cove of a bar before the 24 hour caf√©, and you know the sun isn't anywhere near to being up yet, and it's my Friday (Saturday) so why don't we just stop in for one more beer? (I'll have to do a separate caf√© review, hm.)\n\nGold Spike became something of a last stop before going home. Okay, the last stop before we went to another area with a cluster of bars. \n\nWe used to make a joke that the renovations turned the wonky beat up 60's dive casino into a state of the art circa 1980's designed casino. And if you've ever been to Spike in those early days, you know it's definitely the Bellagio of what it used to be. But there was comfort in the simplicity of the design, and they used lighter colors. It's tough downtown away from the canopy for a business to pull off a dark look and also not appear shady. \n\nThis time Spike was bought out by a financially more stable bidder. I never got to take part in the Sexy blackjack when they had it. Can Gold Spike do well as a boutique business with no gaming? The only business I can think to compare it to than I've been to before is Platinum. \n\nIt's odd for a business to close a place right out from buying it, not maintaining an income, with no major plans they made aware. If there's no gaming, will the anchor tenant be another restaurant? A nightclub? \n\nThere are empty plots of land that haven't been developed in decades, downtown. There are businesses that are dying to be refurbished- lookin at you, Ice House. Why close a running place?\n\nThe replies some people have of any development questions when they decide to speak for developers oblivious to such individuals goes like \"what have you built? What have you done?\" \n\nBusinesses struggled and closed in waves with the economy tanking. We rallied together to go to our favorite spots to give them our business and went to events to support the scene. I vote with every dollar I spend is what I do. We're going to hang out the bars that charge less than $10 for a bottle of beer. (I'm being generous, I really mean $5.) Businesses charging Strip prices...\n\nVIP isn't some place you buy your way in. It's when the bartender (or cocktailers) remember your name and knows what you're drinking before you order. And small downtown bars know and do this and have been around longer than the new downtown shoe-opoly players. \n\nToo many abandoned strip malls in the valley from companies that expanded faster than their openings and quarterly profits. Change can be good, when it doesn't alienate what could be weekly repeat business for tourists that visit a few times before going to the next big opening and not come back.\n\nGood luck Fremont Street and Downtown, I remain a loyal fan!","useful":2}

Obviously, eating atop a giant tower in a revolving restaurant will inflate food and drink prices a bit.  There are two- and three-course meal options available and a la carte selections.  The meal options are a way better deal because you get similar (or the same) entree with additional food.  The three-course menu was $79CAD per person (about $60US per person).  Drinks were $5-$10US, so typical of a restaurant/bar.  Some of the cocktails were a bit pricier but also fancier so you get what you pay for.  \n\nI enjoyed my soup (yellow tomato and corn gazpacho) and baked ziti with wild mushrooms.  There weren't a ton of mushrooms in the entree, but the ziti and chili sauce were delicious.  My husband got the aged ribeye entree and really enjoyed it.  It was a little too rare (even though he ordered medium rare) so maybe make sure they cook it medium throughout and not just one section of the cut.  Since they served bread before the meal, I filled up on a bit too much of that (there was some waiting between app and entree) so I almost couldn't finish my dessert.  I had the sorbet which was delicious and my husband had ice cream and cookies, which he loved.  The homemade fig newton was yummo.   \n\nObviously, the view is excellent.  It takes 72 minutes for the restaurant to make one full rotation and they seem to have dinner timed pretty well to coincide with that revolution.  We basically ended where we started (a little later) so we were only up there for like 90 minutes.  Even though there are a lot of people, it didn't seem too loud and our server was funny and there whenever we needed him.  \n\nWe actually witnessed a proposal in their wine cellar which was super cute and the couple was obviously ecstatic.  This was a great place to spend our 5th wedding anniversary.  We enjoyed the views, the bar below was quick and not super full while we waited for our reservation time, and our dinner came with complete access to the two levels of viewing decks, including the glass floor.  We spent a bit of time down there after the meal and really enjoyed ourselves, even though it was still crowded for 11 p.m. Reservations are easy to make on their website so make sure you do that because it seemed like 95% of the tables were reserved when we arrived at 9 p.m.","useful":2}

There was a lot of miscommunication - here's why:\n\nUpon walking in, we were pleased to see that they still offer all night happy hour on Sundays and Mondays.  (Their happy hour = 1/2 off most appetizers and I believe drink specials too).  The hostess asked us for our name and we responded that we didn't have a  reservation; that we were just going to eat and drink in the bar area. She was not the friendliest, and just nodded.  Side note - no reservation was needed as the restaurant was not busy!\n\nSo, we sat in the bar area and when the waiter came to take our order (we were a group of 4), we placed several appetizer orders right off the bat and said that would be good to start and we'd add more to the order in a bit.  We also ordered drinks.  I specifically ordered my new favorite 'black cherry effen vodka with soda.'\n\nSo when the waiter came back with the news that they were out of black cherry effen and didn't carry it anymore, I was a little disappointed.  No big deal though, I went with the 3 Olives Cherry Vodka instead WITH SODA.  \n\nWaiter comes back with the drinks and mine  looks like cherry coke.  I taste it and sure enough. he's given me a cherry vodka with diet coke - no clue where that came from, but he took it back and brought me (finally) what I ordered.  In the meantime. he came over and asked if we were ready to order... When we asked if the first round would be out soon, he said he didn't put it in yet as he did not think we were serious when we put the first round in.  Ugh - not funny when you're with 2 very hungry men :)\n\nWe ended up ordering more and were all hungry for the first round of scallops, ahi tuna, mixed green/pear/goat cheese salad, corn and crab chowder. and crab cake.  In the meantime, we were given bread and butter, but alas, no silverware, app plates, or napkins... no big deal - we got those within a couple of minutes.  \n\nWe were so happy with the first round. (except for the soup which we all agreed tasted like water and potatoes so we sent it back) that we decided to order more... another scallops. another ahi tuna, a tuna tartare, broiled oysters with a spinach and artichoke fondue, and a steak.  This time, it took an extremely long time for our food to arrive and when it did, the scallops were presented totally different and the ahi was overcooked.  Also, the waiter thought we ordered raw oysters and not the broiled ones...\n\nAt that point, we were done - no need to attempt to correct the order.  The soup and ahi were removed from the bill (as they should've been - we did send them back).  \n\nI have to say, aside from the company, this meal was just mediocre.  I've had great meals at Eddie V's in the past, and hopefully this was just an 'off' evening, but I will not be running back anytime in the near future!\n\nSorry, Eddie V - only 3 stars this time...our meal was a comedy of errors and even with happy hour all night, not worth the $$!","useful":8}

It wasn't very busy on this Friday night and there were at least four staff members behind the bar, and yet nobody working the floor taking drink orders.  It's nice to be able to sit and listen to the music and chat; I found it a bit of an interruption to have to get up to go to the bar every time you wanted another round. \n\nBOTTOM LINE:  I enjoyed the atmosphere, nice lighting and lively music which was not too loud that you couldn't carry on a conversation.

It was the worst review I've ever written for any business.  If you'd asked me two years ago to return to The Estate House, there was no way I'd say yes.\n\nBut in two years, this place has really come a long way... I believe the three star bump I'm giving to my original review is thanks to Zoran, the GM, Chef Gio Osso, and a crew of friendly and attentive staff.  \n\nThe Estate House is still as beautiful as I remember it being in February 2008, but it's perhaps even more beautiful now that they've got the ambiance, cuisine, and service to go with the physical beauty.\n\nMy evening kicked off with a little mixer on the outdoor third floor patio.  Service was fantastic and drinks were strong.  I corresponded with guests at the mixer, but also with many of the Estate House staff.  From there, I went downstairs for a lovely dinner with my husband.  While the menu is still on the fancy side for me, I was pleased with everything from the appetizers to the dessert.  \n\nWe ordered the Burrata and Scallop appetizers, and were served way too much fresh bread to start as well... Turns out they were out of Burrata but replaced it with the smoothest, creamiest, largest pillow of Mozzarella I've ever had.  We cleaned both plates.  Jared went with the Moroccan Seven Spice Grilled Lamb entree and I chose the Honey Saba Lacquered Black Cod.  Both were unique preparations with a ton of flavor.  I could've done without the candied pancetta on the cod, but that didn't stop me from eating way too much.  In addition, we had grilled asparagus and sauteed spinach... (the greens balance out everything else, right?!)\n\nWe were stuffed but were joined by a couple of friends for dessert and shared the bread pudding and a chocolate peanut butter special... both were fabulous.  All of this while enjoying a bottle of wine.\n\nNeedless to say, I am extremely happy I gave The Estate House another shot.  They've come a long way in two years, and I anticipate returning again soon.  I encourage you to do the same.\n\n**They are now open for lunch (which I must say looks very reasonable), and they have all kinds of special events including Cooking Classes, Easter Brunch, Simple Sunday Dinners, etc...","useful":13}

We ordered a pitcher of Hopalicious ($14) which seemed to be less quantity-wise than four pints (about $4/ea), so you'd probably break about even to simply order the beer you want by the glass vs get a pitcher, just sayin'. The dinner menu was reasonably priced with many items in the $9-10 range and several veg options.  I opted for the stuffed butternut squash and the Mister got the dinner steak special.  \n\n45 minutes later... dinner came (wowzers, good thing I wasn't too hungry)!  Indeed, tables seated after us were somehow served dinner before us, but regardless, we were excited when our food finally arrived. The butternut squash was presented nicely, with a side salad and  topped with sliced avocado.  However, it was a bit dry and lacked much flavor besides regular ol' squashiness.  The steak  was undersized and over-cooked... yikes, a double whammy!  Even the veg at the table knew that sucker was nowhere close to being medium rare.  Fortunately our waitress was accommodating about sending it back and replacing it.   \n\nAll in all, ambiance was great, prices were good, service was fine, food was underwhelming.

And not the good kind that shows up randomly on YouTube and features the on-screen debut of RuPaul, ya dig?\n\nSo let's see...about once a month I head to Pickle Barrel, eat a meal, and then buy a jar of their sandwich pickles at the takeout counter to enjoy at home. I've done this about a dozen times and most of the time it's a hassle-free mission. One time I had to explain where to get the pickles, but otherwise it's never a problem.\n\nThis time around, the takeout girl had no idea what I was talking about and even went so far as to accuse me of lying and \"not knowing what I was talking about\" because she had been an employee since day one and had never HEARD of anyone buying pickles to go. From PICKLE Barrel.\n\nSheesh. She told me she could get me some pickles but only if she charged me $1.50 per pickle, because she had no idea how else to ring it in. I told her fine, I'd take $10 worth (7-8 pickles according to her price point). She charged me $14 and then walked away from the counter.\n\nAnd didn't come back.\n\n10-15 minutes elapsed and I was standing there with my receipt, wondering where she had gone (every other time I've bought pickles the person took them from the display case) and when (if?) she was going to come back.\n\nAfter another 5 minutes I got frustrated and called on one of the hostesses to refund my money because I was tired of waiting and unimpressed that the takeout person had just left me standing there with no explanation of where she was going or when she'd be back. The hostess wasn't very helpful and told me she couldn't refund my money, but someone else could. As I was being tersely refunded by another random person, the takeout girl came back with a plastic bag of pickles and plopped them down on the counter to give to me. \n\nI explained to her that a) I was unimpressed that she had taken so long and had gotten a refund and b) that pickles normally came in a jar. In brine. Not randomly in sealed plastic bag the way they arrive from the distributor. She scoffed and I walked out.\n\nI like everything else about my monthly Pickle Barrel experience but this takeout nightmare that I endured left such a \"sour\" taste in my mouth that I'm in a bit of a \"pickle\" as to whether or not I should bother giving them my business again.","useful":5}

We were able to have lunch and do a little shopping together prior to our facials, so that worked out really well.\n\nWe both enjoyed our \"EA Essential Facials.\"  My esthetician was Christine and my mom's was Alina.  They both seemed knowledgeable and professional and had a fair amount of experience.  As with most facials, they also recommended some products for us, and we did end up making a few purchases as well.\n\nIt's worth noting that I made our appointments last week and we did not get confirmation phone calls.  We also were not told exactly where they were located and hence wandered up via a back entrance, which was very shady.  If you're reading this, note that you'll want to enter via the Royal Coffee - next door to The Capital Grill, and then head upstairs via the stairs or elevator from there.  I shared this feedback with one of the staff members working at the front desk, but she didn't seem to be interested.\n\nSo, while the facials themselves were fine, the overall experience was dampened a bit due to the fact that the ladies working up front were not the friendliest or interested in my feedback.

Who sells out of hangers on a Friday?\n\nFrustrated, I marched over to Canadian Tire at 8:55pm in a tizzy PRAYING that they'd let me in in time to run upstairs, grab some basic hangers and pay (I assumed it closed at 9pm). To my delight, I found out they close at 10pm every day! Wow, awesome!\n\nI grabbed my wooden hangers (on sale - 10 for $6) and since there was only one cash open and it was teeming with confused customers, I went straight for the self checkout, which I had never used before.

So, he decided to have his birthday dinner there.  BIG MISTAKE!\n\nThe meal we had last night was a comedy of errors... First off, there were 12 of us there and the way that they sat us (in the Butler's Pantry) was not ideal for our group.  We took things into our own hands and pushed our 2 tables together to make it easier to talk amongst ourselves.  \n\nAlthough Roman (I think that was our waiter's name) had good intentions, our service was horrendous!  We had to ask for menus after a half hour of being seated.  We had to ask for bread several times before it arrived probably an hour later, and then some of us (like myself) never even received any bread.  We also had to ask for water and drink refills throughout the 3 HOURS we were there...\n\nThe menu itself was extremely pricey and fairly limited.  Not only that, but the menu lists a special 'tasting menu' but somehow it wasn't available yet... nor were there any specials.  We all finally decided and were able to place our order.\n\nOne thing that the staff was good at was clearing and bringing back fresh silverware.  I think they moved my silverware around 3 times even though I would've been good with just one set.  Since they cleared my silverware that I hadn't touched before appetizers were finally served, I had no fork even if I wanted to sample from someone else's order... The Wild Arugula Salad that was supposed to arrive with \"Warm Camembert,\" toasted marcona almonds and  blood orange vinaigrette arrived cold and all 3 people that ordered it had to send it back... other appetizers that arrived and some of the people in our party ate were the mussels and the winter squash risotto.  \n\nSo, like I said, our reservation was for 7:30 and we were all seated by 7:45... so, when I looked at my watch and saw it was after 9:30. I was a little bit disappointed that our entrees weren't there yet.  After all, we were planning on meeting some other friends for drinks after dinner, and this was taking a really long time.  I think that everyone else at the table was feeling the same way.  We were all hungry and antsy and upset that the waiter or GM hadn't even acknowledged that it was taking a ridiculously long time.  So, the birthday boy spoke up... and asked for the GM.  I think it took another 30 minutes before the GM came over and acknowledged us.  Note - the food was still not there.  He was reactive instead of proactive apologizing but not offering anything.  He asked what we wanted him to do and we all just said to bring our food!  At this point it was 10pm.  He promised it would be there in 5 minutes.  Ron (another member of our group) looked at his watch and 5 minutes later, still no food.  Roman attempted to bring us a bottle of wine, but we didn't even want more to drink at this point...\n\nSo, at about 10:10. our food began to arrive in piece meal...  2-3 entrees at a time and several minutes apart.  Many of the entrees were overcooked and had to be sent back and the person that ordered marlin was served tuna by accident so when the person that ordered the tuna didn't have her meal, we figured out their mistake.  The waiter then had the audacity to ask the person that ordered the tuna if she wanted a new one.  (There was already a bite taken out of the tuna that was served in error).  Of course she did!  Unfortunately, we were all done 20 minutes later when the new tuna finally arrived.  I had the \"Estate House Fruit De Mer\" which was actually pretty good.  (However, at 10pm, anything would've been good in my eyes).  \n\nWe basically had to tell the GM that there was no way we were going to pay for this horrendous meal... you would think we'd get apologies again or something, but no.  We left a decent tip for Roman, and never even had birthday cake for the birthday boy... bummer!  At that point we just wanted to get the hell out of there!\n\nFortunately, we had much better service upstairs at the 3rd floor level bar where they had a piano player until 11pm.  We met some other friends there and attempted to laugh at the miserable meal we'd just had... Side note - Charles Barkley and his wife were also at the restaurant and had a 3 hour meal as well - we know this because we swapped stories over drinks upstairs after the fact.\n\nThe Estate House has a lot of kinks to work on... I doubt I will ever return to eat there again... I do recommend going for the ambiance and drinks on the top level.  Gina and Bill will take good care of you there... Aside from that, I would tell you to save your time and $$.","useful":20}

(I love okra!)\n\nUnfortunately, the chicken in the spring rolls was rubbery and kind of gross... and the vegetable dish was covered in a really oily sauce that lacked flavor.  I'd probably give this place two stars, but Alfred was nice enough and they serve okra - huge props for that.  Even so, the meal was pricey for what we had... and I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.  I hope it was an off night for their sake.  \n\nAnd now, because of our so-so / not fantastic experience, I am pretty sure I will not be allowed to choose the date night restaurant for a while... :(","useful":9}

So after dinner at Noodles Ranch last week, I picked up a menu from this place.\n\nAnd when my hunger struck this evening, I decided to call in and place an order for take out.  Good thing I decided to take out instead of eat in, because this restaurant has no ambiance at all.  It was empty on a Saturday night and reminded me of the fast food Chinese places you see at food courts in malls.  The people working there were not very welcoming either... and when I suggested they add an eggplant dish to the menu, they basically just said 'no' without even entertaining the idea.\n\nWhen I came home with my bag, I noticed that they didn't include chopsticks, utensils, napkins, soy sauce or fortune cookies.  What Chinese restaurant have you ever been to that didn't have fortune cookies?  \n\nAnyways, I ordered the Mu Shu Vegetable and the Mixed Vegetable with Shrimp in the \"Health Food Section\" of the menu.  I probably would not describe either dish as \"yummy yummy,\" but they were satisfactory. The portions were large and the vegetables were fresh, but the garlic sauce that came with the shrimp dish was pretty nasty.  \n\nI would possibly give this place another chance in the future for take-out in a pinch, but I'd highly recommend hitting up Noodles Ranch, Tottie's, or Lao Thai if you're wanting yummy yummy Asian food instead.","useful":10}

It took a while to get the new table cleaned, but it wasn't that big a deal as I was busy catching up with Laura.  \n\nBut once seated the service continued to be horrible.  Our waitress seemed rushed and took our drink orders but it took forever to get our drinks.  Then, she finally took our food orders and disappeared for a really long time.  I did enjoy the salad I ordered when it finally came (I cannot remember the name but it had spinach, corn, tomato, and cheese in it) and I had a bison burger served with it as well.  Unfortunately, Laura thought she ordered two burgers but was only given one... when she wanted to add another to the order, it took forever to flag our waitress down and even longer for her to get her 2nd burger!\n\nI know this review is only based on one experience, so I am not giving up on Stax...

It's supposed to be made from strawberry, pineapple, orange, ginger and kiwi.  Not a huge deal, I told them to do lemon and orange instead.  And it actually came out tasting great.  \n\nLindsey joined me shortly after that and had a lemonade.  We worked for awhile; it's worth noting that the wifi worked really well.

If you look at their web page, and pics on their myspace account (linked from Rick's site), you can see the shop. \n\nIt's MAN'S barber shop. That's actually not sexist. They actually cut women's hair also and B-rad, genius with a straight razor, trims eyebrows, hairlines, whatever you wanna do.\n\nLet me elaborate... There are things I like to do to celebrate being a man. People talk about Feminism, gay pride, why can't I celebrate being a straight man? In fact, I'm going to have a list of reviews called Man's Day that will categorize these reviews. For instance, I like to have a steak now and then. I like to have my shoes shined. I like to buy a nice fedora. I love burlesque, put on a tie to go out, hot rods and some sports.\n\nSo that's what I mean. Getting a straight razor shave is something I don't need to do. I use an electric razor for work. It's a chore to be done quickly to get on my way. But there are some days before a big event, I want to get straight razored quality shave and have it last a day or 2 longer. There's nothing like a hot towel menthol treatment. Hang out in the barber shop and watch sports on tv, talk shit with the guys. There is another place that caters to men across town. In fact, I lived in that part of town for the opening. But I go to these guys out of tradition. It's difficult to get a man's haircut that's not some quickie boutique place with fashion magazines all over the place. There's nothing wrong with that, but sometimes.... Man's Day. \n\nAll kinds of celebrities are known to have sought Rick out from reputation. Dr J. Has been in there. They have celebrities sign the WALL on the right side of the shop. He';s known for shaving all kinds of designs on the back of people's heads. He has done patterns for guys you may have seen on the Extreme or Ultimate Fighting Championships. He even did a Sponge Bob on the back of a kid's head, just ask to see the photo album while you're there.\n\nThere are bikini girls pictures on the left wall above the mirrors. My g/f enjoyed hanging out there. She didn't feel intimidated/ uncomfortable/ or want to male bash with the environment. I think of it as Al Bundy's barber shop. Or Tim Taylor. The Man Show is probably a bad example.\n\nThese guys are great and it was also one of the cheapest cuts for what you get! It's real easy to over tip and still be less than the last few barbe- uh, hair salons I went to before, while I was looking for a regular place to go. Like all the barber shop movies, sometimes it's not a place to rush like fast food. It's a culture to see what's going on with people in the neighborhood. \n\nAnd a feeling of community in Vegas are in places few and far between.","useful":5}

We didn't get through it all, but my 1 and 2 year olds loved the play area, the light bright wall, the building blocks, the performance theater area, the puppets, the kitchen, and the books throughout.

Just bring the bag back between movies or whenever, they fill it up again! \n\nThere aren't any posts to risk running into, so you have to have an FM radio to tune in the movie you're seeing. I even know what the stations are, but I don't want to post them. You can find that out. But I don't wanna post them because you can be tempted to surf during your intermission, which I don't think is fair.\n\nThis is great, I see kids playing around, families bring blankets. People go up front and throw footballs around while waiting for the movie. If you've never been to a drive-in, you defiantly have to experience the most sadly fading tradition.

We had Raising Kane's chicken and brought string cheese to snack on. Yes, you can bring in your own food and drinks, but we ALWAYS get something from the snack bar, too. Most of the people that go don't mind spending because we all want to keep the last of it's kind going. \n\nIt's definitely a funner experience and environment than all the hassles of the walk in theaters.

They have a swap meet. I always think West Wind could more than double their income if they could get in on this. I know with outdoor swap meets, there are only a few small windows where this is feasible. The heat gets so unbearable that people don't want to spend a half hour in it.

It's usually busy enough that you'll run into a few other folks during your romp around the park. There is an outer loop on a dirt trail through the \"prairie\" that takes about 20 minutes to complete.  (\"Prairie\" is in quotes because it doesn't usually get the opportunity to grow into a long-haired grassland because it gets mowed down periodically.) Besides the outer loop, there is an inner loop of packed gravel with a few other criss-crossing trails connecting it.  \n\nNice things about this park: two parking lots, off access roads to the east or west of the park.  The East entrance is found by driving down Expo Way (longer driveway but a closer walk to the gate from the car.)  The West entrance is found at the end of Wingra Creek Parkway. Here you will cross a small footbridge to access the park.  Another nice feature of this park is that there is actually running water!!!  Yes, just outside the East entrance there is a water fountain and hose for filling up the numerous jugs people have donated. Finally, there is a bike trail near the park so that means Lola gets to come too! Yup, she gets to walk with the Mr outside the park (grumpy pooch isn't allowed in) while Leo gets to run around inside.  There also are at least five gates into the park allowing you to escape at various points along the way. \n\nThe biggest downside of this park is that it closes periodically for Alliant Energy Center events.  BOOO!  The prairie gets mowed down occasionally (ugh!) so they can use the dog park for overflow parking (i.e., Midwest Horse Show) and/or the park is shut down on weekends where they have 5k runs going through here (i.e., Blacklight run). Unless you go regularly and see the signs announcing the park will be closed, you are likely to show up on a weekend and will be sad and depressed to realize you are now stuck with a drooling, excited, beast in your backseat with no outlet.  The city website does have closure dates listed so I would recommend checking that out: http://www.cityofmadison.com/parks/parks/park.cfm?id=1353  NOTE: there are points where they say park is \"open\" but the main park is NOT open, they are referring to a much smaller strip of land on the West side (turn left off the footbridge) that is fenced off along the river, along the bike trail.   \n\nDespite my frustrations with the periodic shut-downs, we will keep going back mainly because it is 3.4 minutes away from home.","useful":5}

This review was placed IN the D (\"as a D\") review. I also tried writing a message to the powers that be to this affect. It has gone with no response.] \n\nOne of my concerns is that Circus circus enterprises- no, Mandalay resort group- wait, MGM Mirage- please, stop, MGM resorts international (wait, what month is it?) will get their foothold downtown. They could change places people go to every year into something generic (but put in cool furniture!) and shut down sections so \"V.I.P\" can buy their way into them. This is how they bump a casino up a star rating (meaning a dollar sign) on the strip. \n\nSigma Derby is a throwback to those old coin cup, black fingers days of slots and gaming. When Fitzgerald's couldn't make it as the Fitz, they were circling the drain and we lost another grand old casino of Fremont. But the D impressed me with little gimmicks and not going too far with the airport hotel look that new casinos jumping on board the de-themeing train do. \n\nSeeking out a Sigma and restoring it to it's own Arena of Battle upstairs was a great move. Even back in the Fitzgerald days, the upstairs was known mostly for their cheaper, nickel coin slots before printed tickets started taking over. We'll give you the convenience of not lugging a coin bucket around if you pay no attention to those tickets with 3 cents you ditched that expire and go into our hidden Superman 3 half penny/ will disappear when an exec retires account. \n\nWhen you approach Sigma Derby, it's like a wrestler entering Madison Square Garden arena. I heard people yelling in a large circle with a huge smoky glow of light emanating from the center and you have to push your way in. I can only imagine from movies that's what it's like to walk up to an illegal dog or cockfighting ring. \n\nDerby is kinda like that arcade game, where all the race cars or units are hooked together in 6s, everyone will have to face the winner at the end and be gracious or understandably hate that fuck, because like life, only 1 person can win within yelling. Everyone else loses and probably paid for that win. \n\nTakes me back to dollar beer and hot dog nights in my early 20's @ Golden Gate Fields. *Pleasant sigh*\n\nOf all the gambling I've done in Vegas, I won 1 medal, against my 5 friends at the race car game when it was upstairs at the NYNY arcade. Imagine if they handed out a horseshoe laurel (and hardy handshake) of flowers to the 200:1 winners @ Sigma. Udamntopia! \n\nOn a weekday morning this game was busy. And there's even a camera to take pics of you, and you can put it online! Instant gloating gratification, yes please! It's a 10 seater and probably the only casino game where I'm concerned when one of the spaces is taped up. Can't they fix it? Don't they know this seat is 20% of the Nevada toy horse derby income demographic?! \n\nThis was a very special machine, apparently it's the same machine I used to play at the New Frontier, it was conveniently located in the main artery just outside the sports book and close enough to the toilets so you don't miss a hot 200 quinella. \n\nWhen you have a shot at a 200 win, I play no less than 3 quarters. Since you get hand pay on 500 or more, I always go for $200+. As much as I love gloating at the ka-chink ka-chink ka-chink ka-chink ka-chink ka-chink rapid fire payout victory salvo, I want a human to come over and count out a freshy stack o Bens as they offer me a suite in the villa. \n\nI bet this is going to argue that I can't post this under \"Religious Organizations,\" but I BEG TO DIFFER.\n\nSo much fun! I want to be in that miniature land, in the center where the horses sit and watch their kind race around them. It's my cool blue ocean when I have to find my calm center in the middle of the weekday grind. I have recorded it on my cell and have used it as a ringtone. Yeah, that's right\n\nI only know of 2 Sigma Derbys in the valley? What say you, Laughlin? What's up, Reno? Your move, California come latelies. Any others on the western seaboard to be found?

In addition, there's a secret crunchy ingredient in it which I love - you'll have to go try it for yourself to see what it is!  \n\nThe next time I went was a few nights ago... it was date night and my husband and I decided to splurge and order from the not so healthy options on the menu: chicken wings (we went spicy on the wings, but there are several flavors to choose from), brisket nachos, and a burger.  We ran into some friends there that joined us and wanted to share, so we added two kale salads and a side of asparagus to get our veggies in!  It was all so good that we ate almost every last morsel between the four of us.  We washed it all down with a few beers.\n\nI like the recently renovated prohibition ambiance.

I felt like I was in Vegas, New York, or LA at the hottest new club!  It may have taken a while to open, but the latest Starwood Resort in AZ is definitely a place to see and be seen.  Luckily, I was with some VIP girls upon valeting the car and we were able to enter right away instead of wait in line.  \n\nOnce inside, we made our way to the lobby bar and ordered up a round of cocktails.  Most of us had martinis; a few had wine.  My Raspberry Lemonade Martini was pretty tasty and went down easy.  I can't say the same for the Candy Cane Martini that a few of the other girls had - they had to exchange it for something else as they said it tasted like cough syrup!  All of the drinks were pricey - I think mine was the cheapest at $11 for one.  We sat in the lounge area and people-watched for a while, and then Halley and I made our way into the W Store as we continued to sip our martinis.  They had really cute stuff and I'm sure had I brought more money in, I would've spent it there!  \n\nOnwards and upwards we went after that - upstairs!  Little did I know that upstairs was where the most beautiful pool and huge patio was!  (See pic)  Great white lounge chairs, big comfy towels, several more bars, and tons of beautiful (and not so beautiful) people awaited us.  It was a great place to hang out on a late summer night!  \n\nIf you do plan on heading over to the W to hang anytime soon, stop by the $$ machine before you go.  Drinks are expensive and valet costs $8 or $10 depending on who you are before tip.  (I was charged $8 while my brother was charged $10 - we figured that out today; not sure why Valet would not be one price so if you know, please let me know!)\n\nSo as you can tell, this review is just for the experience of hanging out at the W; not actually staying there.  With room rates starting from the high $300s, I doubt I will be staying anytime soon, but if you have the opportunity to do so, I would recommend it.  Great location, hip place, lots of eye candy, and Sushi Roku (which I cannot wait to try sometime) awaits!","useful":13}

First rule of vacationing in Vegas or in general is to fully explore where you are so you don't have to go thru an epic battle to get back to it later. I had been here the week before to spend some quality time in the lounge. While you can order food in the lounge (not just the fruit salad in your drink), the restaurant is a whole different experience. I was in the lounge the week before and I had to go back to the restaurant part.\n\nI've been on a mission this particular week, looking for people I worked with. \n\nThe food is incredible, you can see by the pics. Everything IS over the top, but it was already that way if it makes sense. Restaurants now try to make everything over the top with what I call Epic Menu. It's already been spoofed online and in tv. You have millions of \"mash up\" options can get combos that don't make sense just to be creative (i.e. burger taco?). Restaurant developers have gone crazy from all the cooking shows on tv trying to come up with new trends. But here, they just have many... accessories? To things that make sense that you don't get at the national corporate graveyard restaurants. \n\nSomething happened/s at this bar (meaning counter service, not the lounge, just went over this!) that I haven't encountered at any restaurant I've ever been to. The portions are so huge, if you go by yourself, you will have leftovers. That's given. \n\nSo, I have been to the counter by myself before. This is probably the only restaurant I regret going to by myself because I always enjoy going with a committee of people, we always wind up sharing and sampling each other's food. And that's because the 32 volume leather bound menu can give you an indecisive aneurism when ordering. \n\nOne of the first times I ate here was with a group of Goths I started hanging out with. There was one who decided to go to the empty booth next to us and push her breasts against the window. And while everyone was stupid enough to not take a picture of this (this was back when we still could have put it on myspace), the memory of it struggles and blurs every time I try to rethink of it. I just remember black and lace and... volume. I did go on to date her after months of hanging out \"as friends.\" and it was damn worth it. I have to mention the best off the menu special I ever got here, amirite? \n\nSo, at the counter, hungover one night by myself, I had a bunch of leftovers and I seriously doubted it would make the long journey home. I was walking since my motorcycle was possibly at Sahara, or Stratosphere, that kind of night. A couple of seats down this cute couple of girls were also finishing their meals with 2/3's left over as well. They asked me if I wanted to scoot over and help them finish. And then we ate our meals, hey-ooo! See what I did there? They were on vacation and their next trip, we got together again. You probably know I love Peppermill, right? \n\nThere was one more story I wanted to tell, but you get the idea of how great this place is. We went here the night they imploded Stardust. I'll have to figure out where I can continue that story unless I want to do a clearly obsolete review of Stardust? the only place more over the top than the Peppermill is the Peppermill CASINO in Reno. My best attempts would underdescribe that LSD farm.","useful":3}

My host mom made it a few times and it was always super fun and amazing.  \n\nSince they didn't open until 5:30 p.m., we decided to eat dinner there on our way back from our afternoon of sightseeing.

Since you're eating at La Raclette, you MUST order raclette as your entree.  Here's the deal: raclette is a type of cheese from Switzerland that is melted and poured on various meats, veggies, and tubers.  The raclette \"maker\" works like this: you have a metal tray that is either inserted or placed onto a hot, metal surface with cheese on top so it melts and gets super gooey.  You then take this gooey, melted cheese and pour it all over the meats, veggies, and tubers.  The raclette entree comes with potatoes, assorted veggies, deli meats, cornichons, and bread.  Pour at will and enjoy.  You will NOT be disappointed.\n\nI absolutely LOVED this place and would go back in a heartbeat if I find myself in Montr√©al some time in the future.

We stood like idiots at the hostess area until somone asked us if we needed something. \n\nWe sat ourselves, and then sat and sat and sat because there was no server assigned to us. Perhaps that is a reason to seat patrons, so a server knows they've arrived?\n\nFinally, the hostess asked us if anyone had helped us, and she was very polite and took our order. \n\nOur drinks came out fairly quickly, but then we waited and waited for our food. This would have been understandable if the placed had been packed, but it wasn't. It was maybe 75% full (7:30 on Saturday) and there seemed to be plenty of servers. There was one large party on the patio.\n\nI ordered the vegetarian salad (can't remember what it was called) that advertised avocado, jicama, beans, and other yummy things. When it arrived, there was a tiny little mushy sliver of avocado perched on top, and no more to be found. It was as if someone scraped up the dregs of an avocado from the rind of an empty one and flung it on my salad. It would have been more forgiveable if they had just forgotten it altogether. Also, the white beans were undercooked. \n\nThe pizzas were good. I ordered the local organic vegetable one without cheese, and it came loaded with summer squash, roasted carrots, olives (local? Hmm...), leeks, roasted onions, and the crust was thin and crispy. My husband also enjoyed his pizza. \n\nI should actually grant an additional half star to the hostess/waitress, who comped my salad when I complained about it. I was willing to pay for it, but she offered to take it off the bill. \n\nThe final nail in the coffin was perhaps not the fault of the restaurant, but the large party out on the patio had 3-4 elementary-age kids literally running laps through the restaurant for the first 15-20 minutes we were there. If ignorant parents are content to let their hellions ruin other diners' experiences, then I'm afraid it's left to the restaruant to politely and discreetely ask the parents to please reign them in.

My chai latte was expertly sweetened and topped off with a smidge of butterscotch (yum). I also had the house-recommended iced tea - a combination of black and green tea, sweetened with honey - but you can choose from any of a selection of ten looseleaf teas for your brew. There's also a kickass lemonade that can be heightened with flavour shots like watermelon, lime and mint.\n\nSolid, reliable wi-fi, ample electrical outlets and decent food options (I heard a few people order a roast beef sandwich, various bagels and I also spotted a hard boiled egg baked into a piece of cornbread). All in all, a relaxing atmosphere for getting work done.","useful":7}

It hit me over the last few weeks that I needed to get my act together and order a crib and dresser.  The problem was, I had my mind set on ordering something grey, and since the gender of the baby is going to be a surprise, it had to be universal - not too masculine or too feminine.\n\nI did find a couple of local stores that carried nice lines, and of course there were also some options at big box stores like Buy Buy Baby and Restoration Hardware.  However, when an out-of-state friend of mine suggested I look into a particular crib she'd found, I did some more research, and that led me to Crismon's Baby Boutique.  \n\nIt turns out that Crismon's not only carries all kinds of children's clothing and accessories and specializes in Christening outfits, but they also offer competitively priced furniture and gifts!  I was very happy to learn that they work with Franklin & Ben, a really unique nursery collection that I initially found online and through my friend in Chicago.  When I called to inquire and learn more, I spoke to Lisa, and she was extremely helpful.  My husband and I went in and met Lisa in person and several days later, we decided to place an order.\n\nSo at the moment, we're playing the waiting game, but I can't wait to furnish the nursery with an awesome convertible crib and double wide dresser in a gorgeous weathered grey color from Crismon's.\n\nCrismon's is a family-owned business serving the Phoenix area since 1979.  Check their hours before you head over to visit, as I believe they are only open Wednesday - Saturday.

Probably the most solid place in Vegas.  There are MANY reasons to stay here.  If I had to choose one property on The Strip, this would be it because I have come back time and time again over the years and have never been disappointed.  I can't say that about other properties for one reason or another.\n\nLet me start by saying that there is one potential negative.  It is always busy/crowded.  Ok, maybe not at 4am when I usually lurk around looking for that paying slot machine, but during the day.  There are tons of hotel guests, show-goers, locals in the poker room, staff, tourists taking photos, and on and on.  \n\nThis is the place to be...Ground Zero on The Las Vegas Strip, if you will.  That makes for a major potential positive.  I consider the location to be one of the biggest assets because you can pretty much walk to anything on The Strip.  You have access to the new City Center, opening soon.  You can cross the street and hit the \"cheap\" gambling halls like Bill's and O'Shea's.  Caesar's Palace is right next door, along with The Mirage, Paris, Planet Hollywood, Treasure Island, etc.  The list goes on and on.  The Bellagio is central.\n\nHaving said that, I have also found The Bellagio to be a great place to spot celebrities, and I don't go the The Bank, the resident nightclub.  I am talking about on the elevators, which is where I seem to bump into people.  To date, I have ridden elevators with Andy Garcia, Amaya from The Real World, and Bam Margera.  I have also seen a wide variety of televised poker stars in the poker room.  That is an everyday thing.\n\nWIthin the property, there are a number of things to see and do.  The Fountains are the most obvious must-see attraction, but don't forget to see the Bellagio Conservatory and Botanical Gardens.  It is amazing, changes frequently, and never fails to impress.  While there, sneak around the corner and grab a dessert treat from John Philippe Patisserie.  You will love it, chocolate waterfall and all.  Also, be sure to see the Chihuly glass display in the lobby, as well as his retail store near the Conservatory.  There are a lot of high-end boutiques like Louis Vuitton and Bottega Veneta lining the halls if you want to drop some coin.  There are also a lot of nice restaurants, allbeit pricey ones.  Fix is good.  The spa is lovely, and has been renovated over the years.  I had a wonderful massage treatment there about 6 months ago.\n\nIf you like gambling, this is a very nice place to play with higher stakes.  The poker room is large and nice.  The sports book is top-notch.  If you want to see the opposite of top-notch, hit The Tropicana.  The bartenders are very friendly and informative and the cocktail waitresses are among the best on The Strip.\n\nThe basic rooms are very nice.  They are above average when compared to other basic rooms on The Strip.  They have nice built-in cabinets/wardrobes that feature flat-screen televisions, a nicely stocked mini-bar, iron and board, a safe, robes, slippers, full-length mirrors and the ability to close away all of your personal belongings.  This is a nice touch.  The beds are very comfortable, and the drapes are operated by electric motors with the flick of a switch.  The bathrooms have glass-enclosed showers and soaking tubs as well as his and hers sinks.  The only negative is that you can hear things in the hallways from these rooms.  Doors slamming, knock-knock-housekeeping, etc.  If you reserve this type of room, request to be in the main tower, preferably facing the fountains.\n\nIf you move up to one of the suites, it becomes an entirely different ballgame.  The Grand Lakeview Suite (my personal favorite) is amazing.  To start, it is several thousand square feet situated right in the middle of the hotel, facing the water show.  In addition to that, it has two balconies that are accessible from the living room and both bedrooms.  The foyer is grand, with a powder bath.  The main living area, dining area for 10, and bar face out to The Strip and the water show.  Stunning!  The bedrooms are huge, have the pop-up tv's at the foot of the bed, and his and hers bathrooms.  Not his and hers sinks...bathrooms.  Each bathroom has a steam shower, a jacuzzi tub or something else.  There are tv's everywhere.  I had a funny thing happen once in this suite.  I ordered room service (which is really good here by the way) and when the delivery arrived, the gentleman seemed disappointed to see me.  He was very polite but said that he thought he was going to Ben Affleck's room.  Apparently, Ben was staying in the same suite as us two floors up.  I gave him a hard time for not being excited to see ME!\n\nThe next step up (the top step) is into a private villa.  I am going to let you experience this one for youself.  They are special.  Think private gardens, private pools and original art special.  Too much to describe in a 5,000 word Yelp review.  If you are interested, email me.","useful":5}

Fortunately there was space at the bar so we were able to snag some drinks while we waited.  On my second visit, it was 5pm (opening time) on a Sunday. We were able to get seated immediately (yippee!) but the place was definitely filling up by the time we left at 6:30pm.  The ambiance is nice; warm and cozy, with a small front room with two tables and the rest of the seating in the back of the house/restaurant. We sat in the main part of the restaurant (overlooking the backyard) both times I was here and at risk of sounding like my Mom... it was loud!  I think the low ceilings combined with the hardwood floors just really made sound bounce around. The Mister and I were both struggling to hear eachother, even at our small table.  \n\nDuring both visits, the food was great. They also have a nice beer list but it makes me nuts that only the beer names are listed and not the type (i.e., IPA, stout, etc.). I know what type of beer I like but don't always recognize craft names so this presented a challenge. Fortunately, one I could overcome.  \n\nThe Mister and I ordered a pizza each, which was plenty as we both had leftovers. We probably could have gotten away with one pizza if we'd ordered a salad and appetizer.  I had the basic pie ($9 + toppings cost $1-$3/ea) with mushrooms and was pleased with the thin crust and generous portion of toppings. On a subsequent visit I went with three other friends and we  ordered two of the specialty pizzas and an appetizer - this was the perfect amount of food for the four of us. We had the two vegetarian pizzas: The Barberini ($14 - ricotta, garlic, calabrian chilies, tomato sauce, watercress, honey) and The Goomba ($13- garlic cream sauce, house blend cheese, mushrooms, fresh herbs).  I never would have ordered either of them on my own (\"watercress and honey on a pizza?!\" and \"ugh, garlic cream sauce sounds too rich\") BUT I was proved wrong b/c both were excellent.

We both got drinks off of their menu, but we were told that they could make us whatever we wanted because they have a full bar, so I do not know why the other reviewers said that there are only a few drinks to choose from.  \n\nIn the end we were both freezing our butts off (Literally! Those ice seats are cold!) A good tip: if you are trying to get drunk and are worried about the money, pay the $25 for the experience, have a couple of good drinks and a fun time (which is really the longest you can stay and still be comfortable anyway) and then just walk 50 feet to the Fat Tuesdays and get a yard long drink with 151 for cheap! That's what we did and it lead to an overall great time!","useful":1}

Maybe I pick good classes (Ashtanga I, Hatha I, Hatha Restorative) or maybe I have good luck, but something tells me TYS just happens to hire and train excellent teachers. Among the teachers I've had: Lauren, Myriam, Jenny, Cathy and most recently, Rosie. All have been excellent, supremely patient, kind and encouraging. \n\nThe studio itself is gorgeous and I have yet to find a more aesthetically pleasing setting in which to do yoga in Toronto. Located in a 120 year-old office building right at Yonge & College, it's a former ballroom with hardwood floors and 12' ceilings that looks just like the audition room in Flashdance (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV6CPhsxmkU). It was famously used as a painting studio by the Group Of Seven in the 1920s. How's that for Canadian cred??\n\nThe lone studio is huge and can probably accommodate about 40 students (a guess), and classes fill up quickly. My favourite thing about this studio is the schedule - you know how some studios have unreasonable class times? 6am \"early bird\" (yeah right), 12pm \"not-a-chance-in-hell-you'll-get-a-spot-among-the-rat-racers\" and then 6pm \"after-work-rush\"? Not here. In addition to those popular times, they offer classes every day at 10am, 1:30pm, 3:30pm, 5:30pm and my favourite: 8:50pm.\n\nAt 8:50pm, no matter the time of year, it's dark and lovely. I can't tell you what a joy it is to do a class as your last activity of the night and then going to bed straight after (or during, whatever). The Sunday, Monday and Tuesday 8:50pm classes are very popular and at the end, while in Savasana, you'll be hard-pressed not to drift to sleep as the instructors come around with blankets, tuck you in and coo you to sleep. You may not want to get up at the end of your class.\n\nWhat would elevate this to a 5 star review for me would be a better waiting area and change room. The change room is quite small and offers little privacy for those of us that are modest about disrobing in front of people. There are no lockers or showers and the bathroom is shared with the other tenants on the floor. These would be \"nice to haves\" but the waiting area is a must...if a group is crowded in the hallway waiting for the previous class to let out, it can get quite noisy and distracting, and then when the students rush out of the studio, a huge logjam ensues and you're in everyone's way. A small price to pay for a beautiful studio steeped in both charm and history.","useful":17}

CHEESE! The store was a little on the \"sloppy/pack rat/ sweaty/ definitely wouldn't hurt to mop every once in a while\" side. My first instinct wasn't to leave so that is always a good thing. \n\nCustomer service (5/5): I went there because my husband randomly missed Spain so he wanted to make a bunch of mini bocadillos with different types of meat and cheeses. We already got the meat from another place down the street so what better place to get a variety of cheeses than the Macaroni co? The lady that helped us was wonderful!! She was so patient with us even though there were a million people waiting in line.  She automatically knew which cheese to recommend based on what would compliment the meat that we had. She was extremely knowledgeable about the various kinds of cheese. I could seriously listen to her talk all day about the history of the cheese... she made it so interesting.  My husband is VERY indecisive so he couldn't figure out which one he liked more. \n\nFood (4/5): We tried at least 7 different kinds of cheese and I didn't like any of them... definitely not a cheese person. My husband on the other hand, LOVED every single one of them! We also went there for some Rustic Italian or any hard shelled bread. I know this is not the store's fault be there needs to be a sign that says, \"Do NOT touch the actual bread unless you are buying it!!!\" I saw at least 3 people who were squeezing the bread with their dirty hands to see if it was soft. Totally grossed me out. Why would anyone think that is okay?!?! I can understand if you are squeezing the bread through the bag but don't TOUCH it! That is only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

Oh, and let's not forget the dismal sound quality. \n\nWhen you arrive at Kool Haus, there's usually a decent amount of confusion because there are separate lines for ID, tickets and security/frisking, and none of them are in sync with one another. If you're on a guest list or need to pick up a ticket from Will Call, prepare for even MORE confusion as there are separate wickets for each type of pickup and you almost never go to the right one by default. \n\nOnce inside, NEVER check your coat, unless you want to wait 1+ hours afterwards to retrieve it. Suck it up and keep your coat on, or stuff it in a corner and go back to get it later. The lineup to leave at the end of the night is unwieldy so either leave early or keep right as you exit so you don't get caught in the masses of people waiting for coat check (sometimes it looks like just one line). \n\nIf you want a good spot up front, arrive early. Kool Haus crowds are notoriously difficult to penetrate and the layout makes it get packed quickly.

In a strange Vegas way, these things are the setting of a community environment to me.\n\nWhen I first actually made plans to go in there, it was to talk to a potential roommate. She was a dispatch caller for one of those escort services. She asked me if it was okay if all the girls came around all hours for their \"assignments.\" Some of you are shrieking in horror, but think about it. For a guy, this would be immense drama, but would there ever be a better source of Vegas stories in your life? In retrospect, I should have taken her offer instead of moving in with a \"friend\" who wound up stealing a lot of shit from me after being his maid for 2 years.\n\nI went back a couple of times after and thought this was a hooker bar. I noticed a lot of platinum blonds with bling, but the kinda bling that doesn't mark affluence but a trip to the swap meet. They seemed to get called into \"service\" halfway thru their burger. One even brought an old guy in who hobbled in with a cane, looks like he was spending the last of his money for a final fling situation.\n\nThe food there- and most PT's in the chain- are excellent. I had my first really good Monte Cristo there, which is sad because they have since removed it from the menu, damn recession. It's basic burger/ sandwich stuff on the menu. they have specials and their deal is they have 3 sizes of \"buckets\" that are filled with fries, mini burgers, poppers, etc. As I write this, happy hour is from 4-7 every evening where drafts and pizzas are half off. There's another happy hour and I have to guess, since I can't find my weekly. It may be midnight to 4:00AM. Call ahead or google it.\n\nOh, another group of people I noticed that the bartender commented on was cross dressers. There's a group that meets there regularly. In all honesty, I only have 2 problems with cross dressers: 1) Why the hell would you ever decide to wear high heels? Those things are unbearable (someone had shows that actually fit me and tried it ONCE, just to feel. No, I didn't go out like that or anything). 2) more of a question, I don't understand why cross dressers wear feathered out hair and as a group look like a bunch of 40 year olds in the 80's. Their clothes, and look, the dresses and jeans aren't from any other decade.\n\nThe bartenders are cute and the cook hangs out. We shoot the shi7.

I did learn that Florence Crittenton has been helping those who suffer from abuse, neglect, teen pregnancy or mental health problems for over 100 years. Today, the agency provides shelter, education, counseling, and social support for girls ages 12-21 and enjoys a reputation for innovative programs that focus on the individual needs of each girl.  I cannot do it justice to attempt to explain everything that this non-profit organization does, but if you are interested in learning more, I recommend checking it out.

Oh, sorry - mine does. \n\nBut I love sharing, so sit tight and I'll tell you all about her. Another barburning, character-limit-testing review coming your way. I only reserve these excruciatingly detailed reviews for my \"10 star\" favourites, and Darling Spa is naturally one of them.\n\nCome here for a facial to end all facials. I was blissed out, woozy and teetering like a daytime lush when I walked out after my 90 minutes of magic. \n\nLeslie Ferranti was my esthetician at Camden Spa and when I heard that she was opening her own shop I audibly squealed with both terror and glee. Terror because I could already hear my debit card groaning in anticipation of future overuse (how could I NOT get a facial, waxing and other treatments every month??) and glee because, well, read on...\n\nYou won't find Darling Spa noisily beckoning you inside its doors with sandwich board specials or assaulting you with flyers while you shop on Queen Street West. No, you'll find out about Darling Spa from your friends (the ones that truly love you and don't mind sharing their secret to great skin!) and fellow yelpers, because it's quietly tucked away in a building on Maud Street just south of Queen & Augusta. Once inside, you'll start making mental notes of every inch of space for future home decor projects. Leslie's got great taste in furniture and accoutrements - beautiful light grey walls accented by white furniture and black bits of art and other accessories. \n\nThe guest washroom is perhaps better appointed than even my own, with a host of products and thoughtful touches that make you feel right at home - dental floss, feminine products, tissues, makeup remover, wet wipes, the lot. The treatment room and main space are equally beautiful and relaxing. I almost fell asleep during a leg wax, for crying out loud. \n\nSo, about the waxing. As expected, it's quick, professional and affordable. I have a high tolerance for pain but it wasn't called upon here as Leslie is a fast worker and kept my mind busy with interesting conversation and really great music as a soundtrack. Who wouldn't love getting their legs waxed to the tune of \"I Love NYE\" by Badly Drawn Boy and \"Sexy Boy\" by Air? I left hairless and with nary a skin irritation in sight. I'll be back in four weeks.\n\nThe star of the show here is the signature facial. As previously mentioned, it's the facial to end all facials and I think I drunkenly declared those very words to those in the waiting room (can't remember, I was in a state of confusion when I emerged from the treatment room. Imagine waking from a century long cryogenic slumber and you'll know what I was dealing with here). If you love yourself (and you should!) you'll come here regularly for this absolute treat. Leslie herself has incredible skin (try not to stare), which is a lovely testament to her expertise and support of the dermal advice she dispenses. Nothing worse than getting worked on by someone who doesn't practice what they preach, right? \n\nIt feels weird describing a 90 minute orgasm, but I'll try. \n\nLeslie knew exactly what she was getting into with my skin from my days as a client at the other spa, so she went straight to work. I openly accepted a series of hot towels, fine mists, foaming treatments, fruit enzyme scrubs, masks and cold creams (all by Dermalogica) on my cranky and grateful skin. I don't think I even winced during extraction, and there was lots of it to be done. Then came a series of massages, which is about when I had to seriously stop myself from audibly voicing my extreme pleasure. Apparently Leslie also fancies herself a Registered Massage Therapist?! WHO KNEW? Honestly the best massage I've ever had**. I sleep on my stomach and have notoriously tight neck and shoulder muscles. The three-pronged attack of arm/hand, neck/shoulders and then scalp massage nearly turned me into a puddle. OK, I have to stop writing about this now, go lie down and stare longingly at the square on my calendar that marks our next facial date.\n\nNow stop reading.

I didn't explore it but if and when I return, I'll have to spend more time.\n\nThe best part about my visit to Yoga Pura is that it was free!  Yes, your first class is free... so there really is no reason not to go... I was given a \"welcome packet\" with all kinds of information including basic yoga info, the membership info, the class schedule, coupons, and more.  \n\nYoga Pura offers classes every day of the week, and many to choose from at that.  While the location is not ideal for me, I will hopefully plan on dropping in again for more kick ass yoga classes in the future... especially if I happen to be on that side of town.

This is THE place to go for STI and HIV testing, sexual health counselling, abortion referral, questions about pregnancy, birth control acquisition and the like. \n\nIt's a really great place to go if you're not comfortable talking to your family doctor about birth control or if you don't want to get on a ridiculous waiting list for a gynecologist. The staff is very open-minded, compassionate and knowledgeable. The clinic actually lives up to its name - it has been truly hassle free during each of my visits.\n\nThere are separate hours for men and women. STI testing is on a drop-in basis but HIV testing requires an appointment. You can only call to make an appointment during the hours for your particular gender. I've listed the women's clinic hours but there's a separate entry with the men's hours on it. This is a bit tricky if you want to go in to get tested with your new boyfriend (notice I wasn't gender neutral - we all know it's usually the dude who has to be coerced into getting an STD test, right??) but usually you can work it out that you get tested towards the end of the women's hours and they go at the beginning of men's hours. Go grab food at Salad King while you wait for the turnover.\n\nAll testing is FREE and no health card is required. You read that correctly. HIV testing can be anonymous if desired. There are two types of HIV tests and both are blood tests: one is the regular test, which is sent to the Ministry Of Health for assessment and ready in 7-10 days. You call to see if your results are ready (you're referred to by a number)\nand then go in a second time to get the results. Fun, but not nearly as fun as...\n\nRapid on-site testing! They've been doing this at the HFC since 2002. You fill out a sexual health questionnaire that assesses your risk for HIV in the first place, then they prick your finger with a needle, take the blood sample and test it for the presence of HIV antibodies. You get the results in 5-10 minutes, and if it's positive they follow up with a full blood test to double confirm.\n\nYou get a certification that you are HIV and STI free as of whatever date you were there when you leave - a nice little reference for you to show off.

In early October I called to ask \"WTF\" and there was a recorded message talking about how there was a 3G outage in all of Toronto and that they were working on restoring the network, but in the meantime, that was the reason for the dropped calls. Two months later I am seeing more and more dropped calls - hardly professional when you're conducting business and your conversations cut out constantly. I called to ask for an update and the rep denied that there had ever been a problem, and \"didn't know what I was talking about.\"\n\nINTERNET\nNot 30 minutes after getting off the phone with Rogers iPhone support, my internet went down. This has been an ongoing problem for three months and Rogers has absolutely no desire to fix it, the same way I have no desire to become a Hare Krishna or cultivate a garden of cilantro and red onions. Two hours later it's still down, and as usual, it's not their fault - \"it must be your router.\" That's their stock answer even when it's clearly a Rogers issue. I'll be cancelling tomorrow, as soon as I set up an appointment with an alternative and change my email subscriptions that are routed to Rogers.\n\nROCKET STICK\nWhen you work from home and your internet service is routinely down for hours a day, life is frustrating. For that reason I bought a wireless Rocket Stick from Rogers as backup. So when my internet went down today, I thought, \"ugh\", but at least I had my Rocket Stick. Guess what didn't work? Called tech support (third time in two hours) and out of the blue they said I'd have to download some drivers, which I of course couldn't do because my internet was down. \n\nIn summary, Rogers cares more about acquiring new fools to sign up for their shoddy service than to take care of the ones that have (inexplicably) stuck by them for 8 years.

I hadn't been since their grand opening party last January.  Back then, I remember enjoying the sushi but thinking it was a little 'sceney' for my taste.  I did enjoy it though.  Not sure why it took me so long to return.\n\nLast night was so much fun.  It probably helped that Yelp was the featured guest at the event so I had tons of people to talk to and tell about Yelp.  In addition to Raven being amazing and the crowd being friendly, I found the staff extremely attentive.  Nicki was my waitress and took amazing care of me, and the rest of the staff had her back as well.  My drinks stayed full all night long thanks to the staff.  A few hours into the event, my stomach started growling a bit - dinner time!  I opted to go with the Chilean Sea Bass entree instead of sushi.  Chilean Sea Bass is my favorite fish!  Sutra's version did not disappoint.  It was maybe cooked a tad too long but it was still delicious, and each bite melted in my mouth like butter...  Served with sticky rice and bok choy, it was a big portion and I pretty much licked my plate clean.  \n\nAlthough Dottsy said she didn't love the sushi rolls she ordered, I've heard it's decent from some other friends.  In addition, they have half off Tuesdays for everything on the menu (double check that fact) - you can't go wrong with that!\n\nSutra may be sceney - it's at Barcelona after all; what do you expect?  I have a feeling I won't wait so long for my next visit - maybe I'll even go for Raven's event again (the 2nd Wednesday of every month).  If you go to Sutra, just know it's a place to see and be 'scene.'  Raven's events draw a different, more comfortable crowd. Either way, t's all about setting appropriate expectations!","useful":6}

Bagel Stop used to be. I just had to swoop in and see what it was about. \n\nMuffin tops (like the ones you find at Panera Bread in the U.S., but in fun flavours like white cherry chocolate), oatmeal for breakfast, and the ultimate chef d'oeuvre - the gourmet cookie OR cookie sandwich (!) as created by ME (or you). \n\nPicture this: a make-your-own, on the spot cookie ($2.50), customized from the very dough it's based on to the mix-ins you select from a list of twenty yummy options. For the gourmet dough, choose between oatmeal, classic or peanut butter. Then add mix-ins like dark/milk/white chocolate chunks, M&Ms, butterscotch chips, sprinkles, almonds, pecans, pistachios, walnuts, mini pretzels, raisins, dried fruit or toffee pieces. \n\nThen watch as a cookie artiste bakes your cookie in the oven and brings it to you when it's ready two minutes later. Voila! I was in awe. For my combination I selected gourmet classic dough, dark chocolate chunks (naturally) and then opted to spread the baked lot with raspberry jam. The massive cookie was perfectly baked, soft & chewy and the addition of the jam was not a mistake - it gave the cookie the right amount of moisture and zing. \n\nSweet Flour has a list of the latest favourite cookie combinations on its chalk board, a suggestions box that's teeming with feedback, and a peppy staff and clientele that all seem super chuffed to be part of such a fun dessert experience. \n\nI imagine this would be a super popular spot for a date night, an outing with young children, during lunch or spare for high school kids and pretty much anyone who loves fresh cookies. I took about a thousand photos to mark my visit! \n\nTotally unique and lighthearted - I can't wait to go back!","useful":8}

So $13-18 just for a combo, and that doesn't even include a drink!\n\nI ordered the mac & cheese, which had a three cheese cream sauce topped with white cheddar and chopped tomatoes. You could tell the cheese was good quality and it was just cheesy enough to comfort me but not make feel like a lactard.

He couldn't have been friendlier, seating us immediately (just the way it should be when you have a reservation)! I noticed that the restaurant was packed and everyone around us seemed to be enjoying themselves - that was a good sign!  Plus the fact that I bumped into Jenn H, and I know she's got good taste, so when she recommended a few of her favorite menu items, I listened!\n\nThere were 3 of us dining, and I know we all enjoyed every moment, every sip, and every bite!  We each had a glass of wine to start - I went with the Kim Crawford Sauv Blanc.  Looking over the menu, it was difficult to decide on what to order - everything sounded unique and appealing.  After asking our waiter, Robert, for his opinion, I flagged Eliot down to ask what he thought between the Skate Wing and the Scallops.  He sold me on the Skate Wing... and I would order it again and again!  But before I get there, I have to mention that the table sampled the Gougere with mushroom duxelle and port wine syrup... (a special treat that was not on the menu).  We also tasted the Spinach Mezzaluna - a handmade ravioli stuffed with ricotta, mascarpone, and pecorino.  It was incredible!  I truly savored each bite! Oh, and how can I forget the fresh bread and olive oil brought to our table?  Truly, the freshest tasting olive oil... I'm not kidding!\n\nOn to the entrees... (pictured above).  My companions fancied their scallops and halibut immensely.  We traded a bite for a bite so we could each try all three entrees too, and they were all pretty amazing.  I will say, however, that Eliot (and Jenn H) steered me right in suggesting the Skate Wing.  I pretty much licked my plate clean!\n\nWe were all full after the entrees but decided that dessert would be a good ending to this phenomenal meal... so, what did we do?  On top of the cotton candy, we shared the donuts and the apple risotto.  We may as well do it right, right?  Wow!  We sure did do it right... the donut holes were served with 3 dipping sauces, and while I'm not a donut person, these were pretty amazing.  I hadn't treated myself to Cotton Candy since I was a little girl, so that was a fun addition of sugar shot right into my system... you have to have some, it's their signature dessert!  Finally, we went for one more indulgence... the apple risotto - oh, the apple risotto.  Fantastic!  Tiny pieces of apple sauteed with butter, sugar, honey, and more... topped with a salty butter flavored ice cream.  I know there were some additional ingredients that I'm missing here, but OMG... need I say more?\n\nIn some of the press I've read about this place, it's referred to as \"fine dining in a casual atmosphere at an accessible price.\" I would agree with that - although I do think the 'accessible price' part is relative.  I would consider this more of a 'special occasion' type of place because of the $$ you'll spend here - $50 pp more or less.

I could watch it one hundred times over and never get bored. \n\nMy boyfriend and I made a big to-do about the whole night. We got all dressed up and went to Todd English's Olives for a fancy dinner and then headed over to the O theater. The theater itself is absolutely beautiful. We were seated in section 105, aisle seats, 2nd row from the stage. These were the cheapest seats ($93.50 + tax) because they were in the \"limited view\" area. I was a little worried about this when we bought the tickets, but we definitely did not have a limited view! There is a bit of a corner where the performers come out, so you are not able to see the very edge of the side that they are actually trying to hide (there are so many people and pieces of equipment back there!), so I would recommend getting these seats because you are close enough to see the amazing details of the costumes and makeup and you can see everything perfectly on stage for a cheaper price! Also, I did not get wet in these seats, so I really do not know what people are complaining about. I felt maybe one or two drops and a light mist for a few minutes during a specific scene in the performance (I don't want to give it away!), but I was in a nice dress and had just done my hair, so believe me, I would be the first to complain if this was actually a problem. \n\nThe performance was stunning. I can't believe how people are not impressed by these feats. I must say that my favorite performer was the fan dancer/drag guy =]. The human body is absolutely amazing - it must have taken them years of practice to perfect their skills. I have an immense amount of respect for these people. Not only did the performers have strength, endurance, and bravery (you could never get me that high in the air), but they seemed to truly care that the audience was excited about what they were doing. I also found that there was a plot to the performance, although I won't say what it was because I do not want people to get mad for me giving it away. Maybe I just made up a story in my head, but I really think the performance can be anything that you really want it to be. It's art - they are creative, you should be too! \n\nI know it is a bit expensive to go, but it is not an everyday occurrence, so I definitely recommend splurging - it is something you will never forget!","useful":4}

Bacon wasn't listed on the menu, but the otherwise vegetarian soup came with bits of it as a garnish.

The portion of fish was ENORMOUS - I hungrily mowed through half of the meal and there was enough left over for the next day's dinner.

Perhaps she was having a bad day but honestly, it was a real turnoff. Luckily the food was excellent enough for me to want to come back...I'm just not rushing to do so.

The bolognese was rich and decadent, just like it should be. \n\nEntrees:\n\nI had the spinach linguine ($22) with assorted seafood. I was hooked by the boast of fresh pasta...usually I skip the pasta section when I go out to eat because I can make it just as well at home, but I am a sucker for fresh and this was no disappointment! It was a generous portion (not huge, but adequate) with large pieces of halibut, scallop, and probably some other white fish. The sauce was a delicate garlic cream sauce that barely coated the noodles; it was a nice change from the typical heavy, soupy cream sauces you typically get. \n\nHusband had the pork osso bucco ($19 maybe?) , which he said was excellent. It looked beautiful; I didn't try any. \n\nOf course we devoured the cotton candy; that was actually the main reason I had wanted to try noca. I loooove cotton candy, and it is such a fun touch. \n\nWe ordered dessert ($9), which was possibly the best part of the whole meal. It was a tart, heavenly passionfruit cream smothering an almond dacquoise, sprinkled with sheets of mereingue and topped with a scoop of coconut sorbet. I was actually pretty close to licking the bowl, manners be damned. \n\nThere have been complaints about portion size...know before you go, this is no Applebees. You are not going there to stuff your face with greasy fried. You are going there for a sophisticated culinary experience, part of which is the beauty of the presentation.\n\nI had expected to plunk down at least $100 for this meal. While I was super excited to have them comp it, I would have gladly paid for it. And it wasn't terribly expensive, because we didn't order drinks.  I think that's where noca gets the pricey reputation, because you can easily spend more on alcohol than on the entire meal. \n\nWe can't wait to go back! Thanks, noca, for making our Christmas Eve dinner an outstanding experience.","useful":3}

We've been to all the casino gift shops and they have a few casinos of their used decks, some dice, a few books and- holy MOTHER, look at everything in here! It's a large store and right away you see shelves of cards, a wall of books and off in the distance there are service counters and 1/3 of the store are vintage slot machines. \n\nI'm pretty sure if you put a change machine and allowed people to play the old machines, your income would quadruple! \n\nIt was a big priority for me to come back here because I had been shop blocked and teased by having (been) driven past here 3-4 times in one week. Would it still stand the test of time of the years I haven't been able to come here?\n\nOnce inside, it took me about 15 minutes to acclimatize. There's always a big wow factor walking in. There are too many sections, where to begin? \n\nPlaying cards: It's cool that with some of the decks have 52 different facts/ pictures on the face side and they have a sample pack out, so people don't use their grubby little fingers to bust open a freshie. I admit I slacked on a few casino closings, but I managed to get Aladdin and a couple other casinos soon after they closed when I didn't get it from the source. But they do sell out. \n\nPoker chip sets: And by the way, they're really cheques, occasionally you can impress someone in the pit knowing that. You can pick the size case/ set you want, you can pick all kinds of pre made picture sets. I like the vintage ones, pin up girls, old cars. Check out the online catalog. \n\nYou can even make your own set, make your own design. The GGC made poker chips for movies & tv, too: CSI, Ocean's 11, Rush hour 2, Las Vegas the (NBC) series, etc. They helped me with a design and it was a big deal to give them out to friends, etc. You can even drill a hole in them to wear on a chain. The lady even e-mailed me a sample proof of what my design looked like for my approval reply. \n\nThere's a bargain bin of left over/ cancelled sets or imperfections. I managed to cobble together a decent regulation weight practice set that I used with a craps dealer work book. They also have videos. I got my first job dealing craps using these invaluable tools, as well as a practice mat with a craps layout on it. It's a whole thing to do \"chip math\" payouts without looking. Sometimes when I hear numbers in a store, I think how I'd stack it in my mind.\n\nPeople always want to know how to play better craps or blackjack. Learn to deal them! Really, if you stared at people making stupid decisions 30 hours a week, you'll definitely know the best ways to (not) bet! When you get dealing down, for some reason you just subconsciously learn blackjack tables on when to hit/ stand/ double. \n\nThey have dealer's supplies, like dealer mats, but buttons also, croupier sticks, etc. They have regulation dice, the new ones in groups of 5 wrapped in foil. They have every color! \n\nOn the back walls, it's just tons of books, categorized by game/ topic. This is the real reason I went into the store. I think I have over 40 books from this place, even after I discovered Amazon. Really, who wants highlighter distracting my gambling statistics? I got inspiration because I'm a writer and look at all these people that got published just writing about gambling. There are books on Keno. KENO, that game you play nilly willy while you have the buffet. (Horrible payout schedule, read about it.)\n\nI love the right section of the bookshelves. The categories get into magic books, biographies, and just some random books that don't really fit into any other category. \n\nThey have a bingo section where you can get daubers and other supplies. They have coin counting/ sorting apparatus. They even have some of the tourist things you can get on the strip.\n\nThe first time I went into the store, I literally spent 5 hours there. This last time, I knocked it down to a conservative 2 1/2. I get 2 catalogs because I usually scribble my wants all over 1 of them.","useful":3}

In Don't Eat this Book, he writes about the connection of Green Burrito to Carl's as an attempt by Carl himself to revitalize the chain. And apparently Carl was fired from his own chain but since rehired? \n\nThere is some dark history with me and this location, but it had nothing to do with Carl's. I had a motorcycle accident out front one night. Actually, I had a protected left turn (left onto Maryland north), and someone approaching at excessive speed from the opposite direction BARRELLED thru their red light to make a swerving right turn- right on my path.

For you flag happy Yelpers, this IS a very unique business I'd say. It does take your money, there are experiences to be had here and it's one of the few living legends on the strip! For a McGM property, that's saying something.\n\nI don't usually get link happy, but this is a unique situation. I can go over this game's history for days:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma_Derby\nhttp://sigmaderbyfan.wordpress.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=45373341755\n\nOkay all me, now. \n\nI believe this game should be cherished like the old mechanical slots that still use coinage off the strip. I understand from a maintenance point of view it may be a time consuming mechanical \"no more stock parts\" burden. But since this is the last machine in what's technically the incorporated Winchester part of Clark county, it's worth it.\n\nSorry, I have no idea where to continue, I never got star struck when doing a yelp review before. I have some of my favorite gambling memories from these machines. See, Sigma Derby is like a mechanical craps table. You can and are encouraged to YELL max Tourette's at the game and no one will hassle you. In fact, they want to join in. \n\nYou pick your quinella based on the winning odds the machine generates. It's a small thrill just to get in on a race that provides 200:1 odds, the max the machine will pay out. BUT, winning and betting more than one quarter on it is a great thrill for something so seemingly simple. HAND PAY is the goal when you play slots or video poker. We were talking about words that sound dirty but aren't with a wise man, who is actually called Lucky (yes a Vegas local), and we always laughed whenever someone says \"Hand Pay\" reacting like Beavis and Butthead. \n\nThere was a time when the largest casino chain on the strip was Circus Circus Enterprises and these machines were in just about every casino on Las Vegas Blvd. Most of them were located by their sportsbook. And it wasn't just this machine, some of the casinos had THEMED environments to match their casino. Remember when casinos were built with individual personalities defined by their very \"can't be changed by new management\" structures? \n\nLuxor had camels that raced around the pyramids. Excalibur, had knights in costumed horses race around castles. Every time I came down that escalator, I still expected Derby to be sitting right where I remember it. I swore there was a casino that had dogs go around the track, but I can't even remember which. Anyone? Not that it mattered in game play, but each racing animal had their own color, too. One night I went drinking with the guys and the rest of the night we called each other the color of our horse that got us our big win. Reservoir Derby night.\n\nThe sounds are addictive: when the race begins, the horses gallop around the track and people start eventually giving in and drumming their hands to the gallup with the race. I did. And these machines right down to this last one DO get the cocktailers attention as people are locked to the table for hours. When we make a big win, we often made a fucking production of funneling our ear with our hand like Hulk Hogan and cash out even if we weren't leaving. The point was to be a jag off and rub it in everyone else's ear (and everyone did take it in fun as they did it on their next win) all those coins plunking in the hopper in front of you. It's the kind of game where you go around and say goodbye to everyone individually when you have to go. Thanks for the good time, my family is whining something about me eating today.\n\nI always hoped these machines would thrive. You could NEVER turn this into a video version. In Fact, Hoyle Casino for your home computer has a quasi bastard nephew cousin version it. Not the same at all. Sigma Derby is one of the last bastions of vintage Vegas still operating while the casino around it continues to refurbish itself.\n\nIf Sahara had a derby machine and they auctioned it off for their closing, I would have done some pretty humiliating and rash things to get the money to take to auction.","useful":13}

Stay as long as you like - no one's gonna breathe down your neck to take over your seat, but they may ask to sit with you, and you'll be happy to invite them over.\n\n3) A working cuckoo clock that reminds you of the passage of time (you might lose track of said phenomenon as you settle in here - it's really easy to!). This reminds me of my grandfather's house, which must have had a dozen cuckoo clocks that chimed together in near harmony every hour.\n\n4) Tim, the owner, is on my list of Top 10 Friendliest Owners in Toronto. He is so personable and welcoming, and he remembers every customer on their second visit. There are many regulars at Pie Shack, and he knows them all. He's a great host and will come around to make sure you have everything you need and to refill your teapot of boiling water without you having to ask! Plus, we recently discovered that we went to the same high school - I never bump into high school alumni!\n\n5) The resident dog, Campbell, is a bearded collie that hangs out by the washrooms is a lovely fixture. He's there if you want to shower him with attention, but if you don't like dogs you won't even notice him. He's like a real life Barkley from Sesame Street. The perfect pet! \n\n6) BOARD GAMES! There's a bunch of them stocked in the armoire by the entrance and you're encouraged to grab one and play. Scrabble, Balderdash (I will slay you), Apples To Apples, jigsaw puzzles, checkers, chess and more. Great selection.\n\n7) Music is basically lifted from my own iPod - it's that much aligned with my own tastes. Plants & Animals, Beirut, Beck, Neutral Milk Hotel and more. Wonderful playlist to work from.\n\n8) I love the decor here. I want Tim to decorate my apartment. It's very country villa mixed with eclectic touches like whitewashed tables and driftwood chandeliers. There's a deck of playing cards on every table and pie is served with unique vintage 14x14\" patterned cloth napkins. There's a new seating area with a loveseat and magazines by the front window for people watching. The tables are communal and welcome conversation with neighbouring visitors. \n\n9) Which brings me to my next point - great conversation! Every time I come here, I'm chatted up by a new person, and my facial expression doesn't exactly invite conversation. Last time, I was challenged to a Scrabble game by players at the table next to mine, and also discussed handheld video game consoles with a 13 year old. All sorts.\n\n10) Oh yes: PIE! Sweet, wonderful pie. You can get slices (√† la mode or not) for $4.50 or take a whole pie to go for $25. I've done both, and the pie heats up nicely in the oven and is ideal for entertaining some pals. There's a rotating selection of blueberry, raspberry, apple, bumbleberry, peach, rhubarb and pumpkin, plus two different meat pies to choose from. I've tried the peach, raspberry and apple and have to say raspberry was my favourite. \n\nA gem in The Beach(es) that's well worth the trek, no matter which part of town you're visiting from!\n\nNOTE: Take the 501 Neville Park streetcar eastbound on Queen - make sure you don't take the one that says Victoria Park as it short turns on Kingston Road.","useful":16}

You gotta try the appetizers, I've had them all. That last one is more about Fresco than an example. \n\nI have since learned to take those affirmations to see how they would fit in a call to the power company as to why you haven't paid your bill. I'm guessing they will still disconnect your power if you try to explain them the Law of Attraction. I understand people rattle off bumper sticker logic like that with the best intention. But I need wisdom that will bottom line, generate income that thousands before me have not tried. It's why I read business books instead of self help books.\n\nOur lease was ending. We already had to give notice that we weren't renewing a month before. We had this dinner because I had to tell her my truck was heading in a different direction neither of us wanted. I explained this to my love, stammering over delicious horchataaaaaah, and mushroom appetizers. We shared an entree. I love our meals together, so I wanted some place special to drop this news and mentally give me strength and comfort to do it. \n\nEach day was divided with too much to do. Each day I still kept putting out applications to the day I got the moving truck. Each day I had to throw as much as I could into boxes and move my g/f's things to storage. Vegas August 110+ degree weather, people. Each night, I had to take us out to do something I loved with no money as if it would be the last time for a long time, if ever again. Each day I had to clean the hell out of our apartment hoping to get our meager deposit back. Our friends didn't respond to our pleading to help us so they could have dinners, go to bars, see movies, things they could never do any other month. \n\nWe were teary eyed during our dinner. I brought a piece of paper to write on, we had to make the doomsday plans. It wasn't even about giving up. Money running out decided what I had to do, what we had to do. I wanted to make things better so bad. Every day she went to work, I would cry my eyes out before I got myself together to apply again. I could count the times I cried before that month on one hand, including my Grandfather passing away and during a couple of motorcycle accidents.\n\nI saved thousands of tourist's vacations with my resources. I was supposed to be able to use everything I knew to help our little home. I fought to keep my hopes up til that morning I had to get my truck.\n\nI didn't want my dream life with my girlfriend and our cat in our own place to end. I had no idea 1 to 4 files of my accomplishments could impede my future.","useful":2}

I just now realized that this is likely due to the fact that their Beverage Director is Bill DeGroot, who is no stranger to the Valley's cocktail scene; this guy is quite an expert in his field!\n\nI'm a huge fan of both Mexican and Asian flavors... I totally recommend doing a mix when you go here.  Some of my fave menu items are:\n-Pomegranate Guacamole\n-Sumo \"Chopped\" Salad\n-Korean Beef Tacos\n-Wild Mushroom Tacos\n-Shishito Peppers\n-Miso Eggplant\n\n**And then depending on how adventurous your palate is when it comes to sushi, you can't go wrong with the following basics:\n-\"Real\" California Roll\n-Salmon-Avocado\n-Spicy Tuna\n\nOr if you are feeling like something a little bit more unique when it comes to flavor, go for any of these:\n-Suzuki Roll: spicy tuna, avocado, masago, chipotle aioli\n-Apple Salmon Roll\n-Or any of their other specialty rolls, all of which sound awesome.  I especially look forward to trying both the Billionaire Roll (japanese waygu beef, snow crab, asparagus, soy aioli, truffle garlic butter, gold flake) and the Sumo Green Roll (wood grilled mushrooms, avocado, crispy plantain chip, veg. caviar+ aji amarillo) on a future visit.  The meet and veggies will balance each other out, right?!\n\nThe brunch menu looks interesting as well... especially if you're in the mood for bottomless mimosas, micheladas, or bloody mary's with your meal.  I hope to try that sometime!\n\nA couple of things to note to keep expectations in check: SumoMaya is loud... it's difficult to hear everyone if you have a large group, so know that going in.

It was a spontaneous decision that the birthday girl (Halley S) made with some persuasion from her fiance and my boyfriend too.  (I think they really wanted Italian food).  Luckily, Brioni accommodated us and we were seated within minutes of arriving.\n\nThe ownership may have changed, and maybe the waiters weren't as HOT as i remembered, but we were all pleased with our experience.  Justin was our waiter and he put up with some random questions from my boyfriend (IE - are all Maryland Crab Cakes from Maryland?) - he'd been drinking all day long; forgive him!\n\nThe warm rolls were as good as ever and we were all happy that there was plenty of olive oil, parmesan, and balsamic on the table ready and waiting for us to dip into!  I started with a dirty Grey Goose martini and it went down real easy... The birthday girl and some of the other girls seemed to enjoy their blueberry lemon drop martinis also.  Some of us had wine with dinner and that was good too... \n\nOnto the food - I had a few bites of the artichoke appetizer (note that it's served cold, but it's tasty!)  For my entree, I went with the tilapia special of the day - it was a huge portion and it was great; served with veggies but I had a side of pasta too (after all, we were at PASTA Brioni!)  Others in the group had the grilled salmon special, mushroom ravioli, gnocchi, chicken martini (this is a special recipe that is really good) and maybe chicken parmesan.  No complaints from anyone - pretty cool!\n\nWe didn't order dessert since we had Sprinkles cupcakes... it was really sweet that our waiter even served them for us - not all restaurants are so accommodating when you bring in outside food).  All that and total per person (of course we all paid for the birthday girl too) was $48 including 20% tip.  Not bad for a Saturday night out for a special occasion!\n\nWe are excited to be moving back into the Old Town 'hood - I'm sure we'll make Pasta Brioni one of our regular stops on the restaurant rotation... maybe we'll see you there?!","useful":6}

I made our reservations online with no problem.  As he said, going on a Wednesday night was perfect - it was not too crowded and we received great service. Claire and Mona took great care of us... great ambiance and food too - To start, I went with the Roquefort Salad (their signature salad) and it was delicious! Jared was happy with his mussels appetizer as well.  They brought plenty of bread and butter for him to sop up the sauce as well - it too was fresh, moist, and yummy. Jared had the chicken entree and I had the lobster... I really enjoyed it - the lobster itself was flavorful and it also had a light sweet sauce (with coconut) that enhanced each bite.  I liked that it came with asparagus as well as a risotto.  I didn't love that the risotto had pineapple in it, but that may be just me.  We didn't need it but J twisted my arm to share a dessert... chocolate crusted cheesecake with an orange sauce and fresh berries - the perfect sweet ending to a wonderful meal!\n\nIf you like quaint, unique, local places, check out Coup Des Tartes - you won't be disappointed!","useful":19}

A shot of whiskey prior to the meal is encouraged, like an offering to the gods and an act of submission. and the laughter, amazement, and groans of pleasure with each course is a part of the pied de cochon experience, just about the best part of this restaurant, and the reason why it was worth every single solitary calorie.\nso onto the food. we began our journey with an order of the foie gras cromesquis: three cubes of the most delicious liquid foie you've ever known. piping hot when they arrive at the table, the waiter warned that we should wait two minutes prior to consumption and consume in one big bite. my bite was ecstasy- breaking into the outer fried crust gave way to straight up hot liquid pleasure. If you don't start out with this appetizer, you'll deeply regret it. other dishes following this bite were also wonderful, although the star of the other three we ordered was the guinea hen liver mousse. a creamy fuschia-toned concoction arrives at the table, neatly packed in a small jar, and sealed with a layer of fat. pickled onions and a sweet shot glass of jelly are meant to top your spread of liver on crisped baguette slices. it was a perfect little appetizer to share, right down to the last bite. the piglet roast, thin slices of loin topped with a luscious sauce of confit of tuna mixed into mayonnaise, was excellent, as were the slices of tangy, tender pickled tongue with spicy mustard. \nand so after a couple bathroom breaks (note the strategically placed tv in the restroom: so thoughtful) and a little more wine, arrived the entrees. the best of the three we ordered? the duck in the can. i don't need to wax poetic on how a savory mess out of a can can be so remarkably delicious. the perfectly cooked, medium rare duck breast combined with a generous slice of foie, and an unsuspectingly delicious concoction of cooked shredded cabbage was memorable to say the least. its arrival at the table is an event, and that first bite of duck, foie, cabbage, and a bit of the toast and puree below is one of those euphoric events that is never forgotten, and sought after for the rest of your culinary expeditions. our other excellent entrees included the foie gras duo, and the boudin and foie gras tart. the foie gras duo includes both the foie gras poutine and the foie gras burger. the poutine was wonderful, comfort food elevated to ridiculousness. that creamy foie gras rich gravy is unforgettable. the burger is the obscene part. sloppy, difficult to consume, but you will try! oh how you will try! after consuming a quarter of the burger, i recall my dining companions desperately trying to pick at pieces of lettuce, desperate for vegetables after the onslaught of fatty tummy saturation...whatever that means. the boudin tart was also good, though i think it was the redheaded step child of the group of entrees. still great, but overshadowed by the other two, and maybe a little heavy on the mustard. but i do love anything with boudin... i'd put it on my ice cream if i didn't gross people out so much.\nkeeling over from happiness, we felt obligated to order one dessert, and opted for their maple syrup hot pot cake. i honestly can't remember what the hell this was called. but i do know that it was sugary, warm, melt in your mouth wonderful. just ask for a dessert that would fit that description. i assure you that the wait staff, perhaps the most amiable i've ever encountered, will be happy to oblige.\nmy goodness, i can't say enough. i, like you, have had a lot of bad meals in my life, lots of hype followed by some sunken-shoulder disappointment. this was not one of those meals. did it exceed my expectations? nope. i expected heaven, and i got it. to recap, make sure you order the foie gras comesquis, the guinea hen liver mousse, the duck in the can, and the maple syrup hot pot thing. ask lots of questions, and just enjoy yourself. and pass out afterwards with happy thoughts of ducks and pigs that died for a good cause. i love this restaurant.","useful":3}

The first time I met a few friends here early on New Years Eve and ordered the chicken strips with fries which were surprisingly above average as far as fried strips of chicken go.  There aren't really drink specials and this place is way bigger than necessary.  It has a lot of stupid jokes about it being ZANY and KOOKY cause it's called PRANKSTERS, like backwards letters and stupid puns.  Get it?  They're NUTS over there, totally OUT OF THEIR MINDS with KOOKINESS.  A comrad of mine ordered the \"Irish nachos\" which were similar to nachos but instead of chips they were fries.  While he seemed to enjoy them, I personally think that's fucking retarded and gross. Like how Filibertos and similar 24 hour Mexican drive thrus offer fries with cheese and a SHIT LOAD of other unnecessary grease for your disgusting fat ass pleasure.  \n\nOn New Years Eve my comrads and I ordered some Irish car bombs which, as I recall, were reasonably priced, maybe six bucks each which is not bad for an instant buzz.  Also, the server was talkative, comfortable and friendly which made the experience nice and lighthearted. \n\nI convinced my boyfriend to come here a second time and try the food to see what he thought.  He got in touch with his inner chubby jr high kid self and ordered what they called \"pizza skins\" which were half potatoes covered with pizza cheese and pepperoni.  These, much like the fries, were total over kill.  Potatoes with a bunch of mozzarella and pepperoni can never be a good idea, Pranksters.  I took one bite and wanted to get in touch with my inner bulimic jr high kid self.  There is a reason you don't usually find potato skin pizzas at other places, it's not cause Prankster's is original, it's cause they seem to just throw shit like meat and cheese on anything and call it something presentable like \"pizza skins,\" which sounds tasty in theory. \n\nDespite the potato pizza with grease-meat and fat-cheese, we got a pitcher of their seasonal beer for five bucks and it was mellow and not too filling and not a bad beer for the price.  \n\nIronically, much like their pizza skins and Irish fries, the service is a little over kill.  We had about 17 servers come over during the course of our meal roughly every 6.5 seconds to make sure we were doing okay.  We had two come over and ask us if we wanted the check after we'd already paid it.  I'm curious as to who got the tip. \n\nIn retrospect though, Pranksters Too wasn't a horrible experience, the atmosphere is dreary yet unpretentious and there is something to be said for the charming ignorance (or maybe it's the ZANY KOOKINESS) that comes with, you know, just adding cheese and meat to everything.","useful":3}

I remember hearing about this Cosmopolitan before it's grand opening just about a year ago, and of course I read the rave reviews that came before mine, so I was super excited when my husband told me we were heading to Vegas for a friend's shotgun wedding and we were staying at the Cosmopolitan.  Stayed there, we did... and we also dined at almost all of the restaurants inside this hotel, used the fitness facility and the spa.\n\nThe hotel is as glitzy and glamorous as you'd imagine.  It is modern and sleek, yet comfortable.  The rooms are spacious and include a sitting area, desk, kitchen, large bathroom, patio (at least our room did), closet, and fluffy(comfortable) bed.  The view from our room overlooked the fountains at the Bellagio.  We also had a refrigerator and honor bar.  The bathroom amenities were quality, but despite being one of the nicest hotel rooms I've stayed at, there were two minor drawbacks: 1- our room was missing a hairdryer (probably an oversight and I am sure if I called to mention it, they would've replaced it), and 2 - the toilet paper was cheap.  Again, these are very minor but worth mentioning!\n\nAs I said above, we dined at many of the restaurants located inside the hotel.  My favorites were: Blue Ribbon Sushi, China Poblano (I never would've combined Chinese and Mexican, but it works!), and Jaleo (don't miss their incredible acetunas aka olives).  Oh, and if you're into buffets, don't miss Wicked Spoon.\n\nBut even more fabulous than the food, was the Sahra Spa... I had an incredible massage here.  I didn't get to spend as much time as I would've liked, but that just means I'll have to return again.  Spa day, anyone?\n\nOne other fun fact for those that are interested in shopping rather than gambling: The Cosmopolitan is located just a short walk over a bridge from not one, but two major shopping destinations.\n\nBottom line: while this wasn't a crazy Vegas trip (it's different when you go to Vegas with your husband than when you go for a bachelorette party with a bunch of single girls), it was a fun get-away, and I'd definitely stay at the Cosmopolitan again!

We had a breakfast frittata sandwich that reminded me of tortilla espanola from my studies abroad in Spain years ago... it was delicious!

They even have a peacock.\n\nWhen we arrived, we found that Bonnie Springs was a lot more than a shelter for discarded animals.

What makes this especially funny/interesting is that this place is literally in the middle of nowhere!\n\nThe animals are my favorite.  Not only is this a free attraction, but you get to pet and feed many of the animals.  Many are in cages or are fenced in, but some are just wandering freely.

Closed-toe shoes are recommended as the ground is rocky and uneven.  I did not see any \"demented animals\" but there are a few that have obviously had some trauma.  I always donate a few dollars.  Everytime I return, the place is larger and there are more animals.\n\nThe old western town is interesting.  Apparently, they have shows on certain days, but it was like a ghost town the last time I went.  We had one funny thing happen here.  We went into the candy store to look around.  My nephew wanted a chocolate bar.  As he was getting one from the shelf, I saw a small mouse run across the floor.  I didn't say anything.

Standouts were the Organic Green Salad with Oak-Grilled Mushrooms, Toasted Pistachios and Truffle Dressing (which I must mention arrives with a very unique presentation), and the Sonoma Goat Cheese Ravioli.  I'm not a huge lamb fan, but theirs was perfectly paired with mashed sweet potatoes... mmmm!\n\nAs for dessert, Seasons 52 supposedly originated the \"mini indulgence,\" which is a small portion (shot glass size) of \"the real thing,\" dessert... in all of its decadence!  I sampled the Old Fashioned Carrot Cake and the fresh fruit, which were both delicious!  The other ones looked amazing too, but I couldn't justify eating anymore in one sitting.  I did see the custom \"Mini Indulgence Cake,\" which features 18 of these mini desserts; perfect for a celebration!\n\nAs Sarah S mentioned in her review, everything on the menu at Seasons 52 is under 475 calories, so you can dine guilt free...\n\n**Fun fact: You can find out which \"Mini Indulgence\" matches your personality on their facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/seasons52?v=app_125847674120672\n(I was fresh fruit the first time and key lime pie the second time!)\n\n****Seasons 52 will be open to the public on 10/25, and I look forward to returning again real soon!","useful":11}

The staff at this location are friendly and professional.  They call to confirm your appointment the day before and they are good about recommending therapists to fit your needs.  The key with Massage Envy is finding a good therapist, and I've found that over time the therapists at Massage Envy seem to come and go often, so it's always a challenge to find a therapist that you really like.\nI happen to like very deep massage, and I usually don't have a preference between a male and female therapist... so when i called last week to make an appointment for a very much needed massage, I trusted the front desk person who put me with Tori. And OUCH - Tori delivered a very deep massage.  (OUCH in a good way if you know what I mean)!  Tori not only gave me a really deep massage and got deep into every area that needed it, but she also stretched me out - like really stretched me out to the point that I felt loose, limber, and and so much more flexible when I walked out.\nI won't hesitate to go see Tori again... but I'm hoping that all of you reading this don't book up her schedule.  My point is if you give Massage Envy a chance - you may have to 'kiss a few frogs' or in this case 'have a few meh massages' but you'll find a great therapist if you are lucky.","useful":9}

It comes with tomato, lettuce and avocado and your choice of sweet potato fries, fruit, or mixed green salad.  It's all really really good.  If that doesn't sound appealing, there is for sure something else on the menu for you - breakfast is served until 3pm i think and there are tons of salads, sandwiches, and much more to choose from.\n\nYes, it's in a strip mall, but isn't everything in Scottsdale in strip malls nowadays?

I was there with Lindsey F, so I have a feeling she'll be updating her review soon too, but I wanted to beat her to it, so here it is.\n\nWe shared the chicken louie wedge salad (iceberg wedge, chicken breast, cherry tomatoes, diced cucumbers, bacon, chives, avocado, champagne vinegarette, blue cheese crumbles, louie dressing, grana padano) although opted to get it minus the chives and blue cheese, and the american pizza (di napoli Tomato sauce, mozzarella fior di latte, italian sausage, spicy pepperoni, tuscan olive oil, grana padano) with mushrooms.  Both were delicious!  \n\nSeriously, the quality of the ingredients in both the salad and the pizza was evident... I cleaned the salad plate and ate my fair share of pizza too... We learned that this type of pizza is an art, and the pizza chef came from another well-known wood burning pizza place in town.  It was cooked just right and we were told it's best right out of the oven, so plan on dining in if you can.  Warning - the pepperoni really does have a kick!  \n\nI love the fast-casual ordering system (order at the counter and then your food will be brought to you).  Prices are reasonable ($9 for our huge salad and $10 for the pizza).  I may have to go for a panini next visit as they look pretty awesome too, and there is a huge selection with hot and cold choices ranging from Italian grilled cheese, veggie, sausage & peppers, turkey, tuna, and more!\n\nI enjoyed my  lunch so much that I forgot to save room for gelato, so I suggest saving a spot in your belly (a g-spot so to speak) when you go.

Since then, we have returned a few times with other guests on the way to one of our favorite hiking spots.  \n\nMy friend first told us he was taking us to the \"demented animal farm\".  He said that this place takes in all types of animals, including ones that have been injured or abandoned in the desert over the years.  We are talking everyting from deer, hogs and wolves to exotic animals like the Australian Lynx.  They even have a peacock.\n\nWhen we arrived, we found that Bonnie Springs was a lot more than a shelter for discarded animals.  There was an old western town, a train, a small motel, a pond with ducks, and a restaurant.  All of that on top of a large (and growing) section of animals.  What makes this especially funny/interesting is that this place is literally in the middle of nowhere!\n\nThe animals are my favorite.  Not only is this a free attraction, but you get to pet and feed many of the animals.  Many are in cages or are fenced in, but some are just wandering freely.  One deer, in particular, ate food from my hand as he stood next to me in the corridor.  I would say that this place is safe for children, but know in advance that this is not like a zoo.  Closed-toe shoes are recommended as the ground is rocky and uneven.  I did not see any \"demented animals\" but there are a few that have obviously had some trauma.  I always donate a few dollars.  Everytime I return, the place is larger and there are more animals.\n\nThe old western town is interesting.  Apparently, they have shows on certain days, but it was like a ghost town the last time I went.  We had one funny thing happen here.  We went into the candy store to look around.  My nephew wanted a chocolate bar.  As he was getting one from the shelf, I saw a small mouse run across the floor.  I didn't say anything.  When we got outside and he opened his milk chocolate bar, we were all horrified to find it was completely white!  Have you even seen brown chocolate turn white?  I told my nephew to keep it as it may be an artifact.\n\nOverall, this place is a trip.  Truly worth a quick visit if you are passing through, but I wouldn't plan a day around it.","useful":0}

I asked the server what they could do to zip up that quesadilla and she indicated they could put in some veggies.  When I asked what veggies were available she replied \"lettuce, tomato, onion, and cilantro\".  Umm.  That's it?  Sigh.  \n\nEntrees don't come with side dishes, beans/rice are a la carte (about $3 I think). Entrees were about $7-8.  One side of beans/rice is generous and could probably serve two people as long as nobody is a bean-hog.  All the carnivores enjoyed their food, the chips and salsa were good, and the service was so-so.  But if we're going out to spend $ on dinner I'd like to have a few options besides a cheese quesadilla with lettuce and tomatos.  Oy!

(Thanks Todd F suggesting we dine here, and for forcing me into sharing the soft pretzels with provolone fondue app).\n\nSpeaking of, do not miss the soft pretzels with provolone fondue... it's worth the extra calories for the fluffy, cheesy, heavenly goodness!  I'm already dreaming of returning to have more of these!  Following our shared app, I went with the Chopped Vegetable Salad.  Considering Culinary Dropout is a Fox Restaurant Concept, I was half expecting this salad to be the same as the one they serve at Sauce.  Afterall, the description on the menu is exactly the same as the Sauce version.  But it doesn't do it justice!  In addition to the \"asparagus, corn, and avocado,\" this version has artichokes, pistachios, and a sweet honey dijon vinaigrette.  I had them add shrimp to it as well, and it was incredibly fresh, delicious, and filling.  I'd totally return and order exactly the same thing since I loved it so much.\n\nHannah was our server and she was awesome.  She was friendly and informed us of specials right off the bat (including prices).  She also mentioned that they serve Pepsi products, which I typically find that servers neglect to tell you; especially if you're a Coke person!  Todd and I both had Arnold Palmers to drink, and Hannah (and the other CD staff) made sure we constantly had refills - I was even given a refill to go, which was much appreciated.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience at Culinary Dropout.  It may have taken me two and half years (since they opened), but I will likely add this place to my regular lunch location and be there again soon.  Anyone up for lunch at CD tomorrow?!","useful":14}

For example, the last time we were there we ordered a bottle of wine.  The waitress brought the bottle (already uncorked) and set it next to me (and I wasn't the one who'd ordered it) along with two glasses (also both next to me).  She poured a taster amount in one of the glasses, set the bottle down, and walked away!  Hmm!  We had to just laugh because the whole thing was so odd.  Oh well!

The plates were very cute and obviously chosen by someone with an eye for design. The same can be said for the general decor of the restaurant and the furniture. So why, I ask, were we given flatware of similar quality to the local elementary school cafeteria? You know, the kind you'll find wrapped in a paper napkin at the hole-in-the-wall Mexican dive that you can bend with one hand. The kind that has forks whose tines are practically in the same plane as the handle and are almost always slightly bent so that you get that uncomfortable sensation of biting a tine that you didn't expect to be so close to your teeth...\n\nI was actually really perplexed by this phenomenon, in case you hadn't noticed. Also, some people at our table had forks that didn't even match the rest (but equally poor quality.) The only thing I can think of is that they were trying to continue to the general theme of recycling/reusing/employing good karma practices, and they've repurposed the flatware from a kid's play-set or something. \n\nProbably won't be back.

As a matter of fact, most people that see me, a first time mom, in action, are telling me I seem pretty calm.  I have to credit this calmness to Desiree Nessline of Arizona Baby Services.\n\nThankfully, I met Desiree through another first time mom (thanks Lori M) and planned ahead (aka booked her services months in advance), so that Desiree was able to spend our first 48 hours at home with us and the baby.  Desiree is not only a night nurse.  She's a newborn specialist and her services include:\n*nighttime care \n*infant sleep training\n*infant sleep consulting\n*infant care consulting\n*correction of \"poor sleep habits\"\n*reflux/colic relief\n*around the clock infant care (24/7)\n*preemie care\n*multiples care\n*preparing baby's nursery\n*short term night nanny\n*short term day nanny\n*traveling duty\n   \nBasically, Desiree is a wealth of knowledge when it comes to anything and everything baby-related.  She helped me with preparing for the baby, the essentials I needed for the nursery, getting the baby on a sleep schedule, breast-feeding, pumping, swaddling, diaper changing, and so much more!  Even after the time that Desiree spent with us, she's made herself available to answer questions of all sorts... I am sure I will continue to use Desiree's services in the future as needed and I highly recommend her to anyone looking for help whether you're a first-time mom or if you have experience already.  She is trustworthy, extremely talented and passionate about what she does, and fun to be around too.\n\nMy only advice: call her asap as she books out way ahead of time!","useful":15}

Many of the reviews mentioned the noise from upper guests (that you could hear walking, furniture dragging, etc.) but not one person mentioned the most important (and one for which there isn't really a solution from the hotel) type of noise: neighbouring noise. \n\nThe hotel backs onto a pedestrian cobblestone street called St-Paul that is open to foot traffic until 5am every morning. There is also a rowdy live music venue next door called 2 Pierrots that produced stumbling, shrieking, singing patrons at the brink of alcohol poisoning every night, so unless you're a deep sleeper or are comfortable wearing earplugs to bed, you won't sleep a wink. I'm not exaggerating when I say that some of the bellows and crashing sounds every night I heard sounded like a frat party gone awry. \n\nThe hotel staff was apologetic and accommodating (seriously, the staff here is great) but admitted that as the weekend wore on, the noise was only going to get worse (and it did) - they upgraded me to a room on a higher level which made it slightly better, but the best rooms here are riverside, so splurge on those if you stay here. For $300+ per night I was expecting my stay to be a little more...charming. It's an old building so the windows aren't in great shape (read: soundproof). \n\nBecause of the restless nights (and possibly jet lag) I can't report on the free breakfast situation because it was over by the time I stumbled out of bed. Also the rooftop terrasse was closed during my visit.\n\nThere was a whirlpool tub in my upgraded room, which was great and much enjoyed (although the jets function didn't work), and there is free wifi (though it isn't fast/reliable). \n\nThere are many great restaurants and breakfast options nearby (personally I chose to go to Olive et Gourmando each day for their killer pastries), and Champ-de-Mars or Place d'Armes metro are about a 10 minute walk. There's also the 55 St-Laurent bus that takes you all the way up to the Plateau and Mile End (and beyond) at regular intervals.","useful":5}

She also commented several times on the shortness of my nails and how she \"didn't like it\" and how I should grow them out. Um. Well, that's how I choose to keep my nails...deal with it??\n\nI should mention at this point that despite all this conversation, she didn't actually speak English - it was an unreasonable facsimile of it. So, um, yeah. She was nattering away with an accent thicker than Randy Jackson's \"before\" photo and I couldn't understand a damn word. Perhaps she thought she was speaking English?

For about $340USD, we got a room with two double beds and a view of Rogers Centre for the Tigers @ Blue Jays.  Seeing a baseball game from your hotel room is excellent.  Staying in a stadium-view room is really unique and a must-do for any baseball fan out there.  The double rooms hold up to four guests for the game and have seating in the form of chairs, a bench, and a nice chair with an ottoman.  The windows are floor to ceiling and open onto the stadium so you can see and hear the game.  At night, just close your windows and curtains and you're good. \n\nSo, $340USD is a bit of money, but let's break it down:\n-You don't have to buy tickets to the game (a savings of at least $50-$100, depending on where you sit in the stadium)\n-You don't have to buy stadium food (no $6 hot dogs or $10 nachos)\n-You don't have to buy stadium beer (so that's a significant savings)\n\nI'd say we saved probably at least $120 not buying tickets and other nonsense in the ballpark, which is totally worth it.  Plus you don't have to deal with the riff-raff of other people near you in the stadium.  It's a nice, private space to watch the game and you're literally in the same outfield area as other ticket buyers, so you can see the field well and it's easy to pay attention to the game.  \n\nThe hotel staff also do not think it is weird at all to roll in with a huge cooler or tons of cases of beer.  Nice.\n\nThe hotel itself is nice.  The self-parking is about $22USD and there's spaces right underneath the lobby of the hotel so you don't have to walk far to get in.  The $22 also includes in/out privileges for your entire stay.  The lobby is crowded on game days, so beware.  There's a lot of people checking in/out and staying in the hotel even though they have regular game tickets, so the lobby and sidewalks can get pretty busy.\n\nOur room was very clean, the beds were SUPER comfortable, and there were lots and lots of pillows.

The pool was super busy but it was nice to swim and was large enough that you weren't touching the people right next to you.  There was also a nice hot tub and towels galore so you didnt need to bring one down from your room.  There was a nice-sized gym with a good amount of equipment if you need it during your stay.  \n\nAll in all, I really, really enjoyed my stay.  We bought the stadium-view room for our fifth wedding anniversary celebration and it was so worth it.  We got to watch an entire baseball game in the comfort of our own hotel room, we made our own lunches for cheap, had our own snacks, and brought our own cheap beer.  A wonderful experience, especially for baseball fans.","useful":2}

My fiance was literally \"foodgasming\" over the onion tarte appetizer (and I admit, my bite of that was pretty amazing) but the perfectly dressed salad filled with organic greens, roasted apples, toasted hazelnuts, dried figs & Premier Cru Roquefort had me pretty much there myself!\n\nThe entrees at the table were pretty amazing too... I tasted the lamb (yum!) and the fettucine (delicious) - but I ordered the baby scallop appetizer with a side of spinach as my entree and I was extremely happy with my selection.  \n\nI actually kept my mouth shut during the dessert course, but from the looks of the various tarte selections at the table and how quickly they disappeared, it's safe to say that none were too shabby.

You can call ahead to see what the wait time is like and a real person will answer the phone.

It happens to be a huge strip club!\n\nI'd just thought I'd give a little bit of background on why I never made my way to the AZ Pink Pony until recently... nothing against strip clubs, but I think in my head, any mention of Pink Pony just made me think of strippers and not food or drink.  It's funny though, as now that the AZ Pink Pony has been completely renovated and re-opened under a new owner, I'm just now learning about all of the history to this more than 60-year-old landmark restaurant!\n\nSo, while I may not have visited in it's original condition, I can vouge for this latest version and can say that I'm a big fan... I met some girlfriends for drinks and dinner on a recent weeknight and we had a very positive experience.  All of the staff members we encountered during our dinner were friendly and attentive.  Our server, Beth, was sweet and knowledgeable about the menu.  \n\nIn addition to a few glasses of wine, we tasted the Nosh Board, Farmer's Salad, the Pony Burger, the Kale and Brussels, the pretzel bread, and the Caramel Apple Upside-Down Cake.  Beth was up front with us about her favorite salad being the Farmer's Salad, and it was a good call, but worth noting that if you want to add salmon to it, it will cost you a hefty $14 on top of the $14 for the salad alone.  Also, if you go for the burger, you have to request it with the fried egg... the menu makes it seem like it will come with the egg automatically (and our did not).  The burger was still awesome by the way, even without the egg!  The rest of the menu looks tasty too... from an 18 oz. \"Niman Ranch\" Bone-In Ribeye to the salmon, scallops, grouper, and Turkey Pot Pie and more... there really is something for everyone!  I look forward to exploring more of the menu on a future visit.  \n\nNext time I'll try a different dessert though; the Caramel Apple Upside-Down Cake wasn't all that... it was more like a simple spice cake; nothing special.  Lucky for us though, the night we were there, we also were able to have some of a special grand re-opening sheet cake... \n\nThe redesign of the restaurant has a clean and classy feel to it.  I love that it offers a private room in back and a nice patio out front.  Needless to say, our evening was great from start to finish, so I say giddy up... if you're looking for somewhere new to check-out, you can't go wrong with the (new version of) the Pink Pony!","useful":7}

Leslieville Cheese Market is also a purveyor of gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches to go, and they usually have a rotation of three or four different varieties.\n\nThey also sell loaves from Epi Breads as well as homemade croutons, cream cheese and other spreads like tapenade, hummus and the like. Sign up for one of their nighttime cheese workshops, with cheeky names like \"I Never Met A Goat I Didn't Like\" (topic: goat cheese, natch). \n\nMy only wishlist item would be more square footage - forget about coming here on weekends or before holidays; there's usually only one person working and there's hardly enough room for more than five people to browse at a time.

Staff is super friendly and they have a snack bar and sell all kinds of swimming and baby supplies too (including baby's first swim suit).  The main changing area is a tad bit cluttered, but there are cubbies and bathrooms and a couple of private changing rooms too.  I like that the temperature of the water in the pool and the air around the pool is warm... and I'm sure the babies do too.\n\nSome of the kids in class were already putting their heads under the water... pretty impressive!

I have stayed at least 5 times at this point.  The service is impeccable, the styling by Tony Chi will inspire you, and the rooms are flat out amazing!  The good news is that the price isn't that outrageous for Las Vegas.  You could certainly spend a lot more for less at other properties.  I know I have.\n\nTo start, the hotel will pick you up and drop you off at the airport as a complimentary service.  They use a fleet of Maybachs, so if you have never been in one, here is your chance.  It is very luxurious, but the ride will be short since the Skylofts are on the top floor of the MGM Grand, which is right next door to the airport.  If a Maybach isn't available, they send a limo, but I have never had that happen.\n\nOnce you arrive at the hotel, an agent will meet you at the car to escort you directly to your room for check-in.  This is a nice touch as I loathe waiting in a hotel lobby for check-in with a ton of people.  They walk you through the MGM Grand lobby into the VIP, where there is a private hidden bank of elevators that go directly to the top floor of the hotel without stopping.  This is nice because the MGM Grand elevators (there are 6 in each bank) are always FILLED with people and stop at nearly every floor.  When you need the elevator, you just walk past the crowds, through a set of double doors, and into a private elevator to the top.  Stay at the MGM Grand one time and you will understand why this is so valuable for a pleasant overall experience.\n\nWhen you get the the Skyloft lobby on the top floor, the design will immediately embrace you.  This hotel looks NOTHING like the MGM Grand below.  It is an entirely different property, and it shows.  There isn't a theme so much as a lot of natural elements like earth, fire, water, etc.  You feel different once you enter, and it holds throughout the entire experience.  The designer created everything down to the uniforms worn by the staff.  As you walk by staff members, they stop what they are doing, stand up, and greet you.\n\nWhen you get to your room, a butler is waiting, complete with white gloves, a tray, and a complimentary cocktail or freshly squeezed glass of juice.  The check-in is quick and requires a few signatures.  Then, the butler will show you around your apt. and the amenities (if you are there for the first time).  It takes a minute to figure everything out because there is a lot of stuff.  I have always stayed in a 2-bedroom unit, but they also have 3-bedroom and 1-bedroom spaces.  The butler will offer to press your clothes or provide any other services you may need.\n\nThe 2-bedroom is approximately 3,000 sqare feet on two levels.  Downstairs, you have a dining area for 8, a living room next to the dining room, a pool table room (sometimes a foos ball table), a movie theater with surround sound and a powder bath, a second living room, a breakfast nook with coffee machine (the kind that makes an assortment of drinks using packets) and a sexy entry foyer with a stairway to the upstairs.  The entire place is luxury and you will feel special just being there.\n\nThe upstairs has large art installation common space between the two bedrooms.  One room has two queen beds and a huge, spa-style bathroom, and the master has one king bed with the even better spa-style bathroom.\n\nThe entire place is completely teched out.  There are Lutron lighting controlers with buttons in the entry that say \"day, night, mood, etc\".  One click and the entire apartment is set.  There are also Crestron controllers in every room and Bang and Olufsen butterfly stereos in the bedrooms and movie theater.  There are iPod docks in nearly every room as well, and the shades are motorized.  The list goes on and on...\n\nThe master bathroom has a huge steam shower with about 9 heads including a rain shower head, a negative-edge soaking tub with led lights and jacuzzi jets, a powder room with bidet, televisions inside of the bathroom mirrors, a dressing area with full length mirrors and lovely storage cabinetry, a scale, a separate bathroom music controller, a large flat screen over the tub, and fantastic robes, towels, and spa products.  The guest bathroom has everything I just listed minus the steam shower feature.  It also has a table with 4 chairs in the dressing area.\n\nThe entire place is setup to party.  The best part, you can go crazy in here with the music on full blast and nobody can hear you.  Likewise, you can't hear anybody else.  It is like a Vegas dream come true if you hate hearing the doors of your neighbors open and close during your entire stay.\n\nI am running out of space, but there is a lot more to share.  There is a service entrance to the apt. where the staff can enter your unit and deliver things like the best room service EVER without bothering you.  I could write for an hour about the food options.  5 stars!!!!!","useful":27}

America! Anyway, minding my own, I was circled by a bunch of orange tank wearing skaters who then circled around me. One of them shoved a flyer in my chest. There was NO way I was going to pass up going to a bout after that. This was back when they were the Neanderdolls and their colors were orange and black. Team players changed as well as ownership of the name later on. This was back when I went to first Fridays most of the months of the year, what a time! 1/3 of my best Vegas drinking (redundant?) stories started from a First Friday.\n\nWent to my first match, LOVED it. It's like Slap Shot meets Klingons meets Nascar. And I love the names, each one has a story and I got to hear a lot of them. I heard about one of the skaters being injured from something that happened outside the bout, so I went to one of their practices at the park on West Flamingo and asked if I could do anything to help or promote. At the time I was mobile with my motorcycle and one of them gave me a bunch of fliers and posters to promote the next bout that was something of a benefit for medical expenses. I worked in a restaurant, so I hit up all the other restaurants in the forum shops and we were all good to go. My job was going around with sales promotions to concierge booths at the time, so I was able to get fliers to most of the booths around the strip. Some booths wanted to promote it to the tourists (and I let them), but my focus was getting the employees and their local friends/ families to come out. It's something they can do that's cheaper than a night out at the movies, boys and girls were having a blast and even their team logo merch was a steal, compared to what licensed \"pro\" merch costs. All you had to do was go once and you were hooked. And a lot of locals will tell you, there's not a lot of things a family can do together that doesn't cost a fortune. It was my experience that tourists wouldn't take a cab away from the strip unless they had other business at the Commercial Center *ahemhomeofthegreendoorcough*\n\nI got to know a lot of the girls and it was the highlight of my week to go to a bout. At just about every other time I went out, we would come across random members of the team. Sometimes they were in full regalia as they skated around, promoting bout nites. A lot of times we would see them around town in bars and restaurants and other weekly events, like karaoke nights. Some of them formed a band, in fact I got to learn what a lot of their other interests and day jobs were. We got to hang out, most memorably at 4:00AM having late night eats before going home. They are all over town doing non profit volunteer work. I attended Roller con a couple of times and got to meet skaters from all over the country, a few I was happy to know from earlier matches. The bouts had KILLER after parties at several places, sometimes Double Down, sometimes Mikkie Finns, sometimes Jacksons, etc. \n\nCircumstances changed and I lost my motorcycle in an accident, couldn't see the taxi number since I was cartwheeling in the air at the time. I also had to take another job out of necessity that paid the lowest wages I ever earned- without tips or commission- in my entire adult life. I didn't get to go to many of their bouts for over a year or so. With the name change to The Fabulous Sin City Roller Girls, they also formed 2 sub teams (for home matches): the Notorious VIPs and the Tommy Gun Terrors. Team members moved away, other new skaters made the team. They even expanded to a 3rd team the Hoover Damned, which I actually never got to see skate because I became one of the Unemployed and had to move back to wherest I came. They get to brawl now and get to set up in a ballroom at the Riviera, man that must be great to finally involve the tourists. Selling out tix is not uncommon!\n\nThey have a cool tradition at the after party of pairing up with an visiting team member, buddying up and switching tanks. This was the most amazing thing to me about the times I shared with these women. The bouts are REAL it's not like staged like wrestling, it is VERY competitive. They get knocked on their asses hard, but get right back up and skate in a sprint faster than before they fell. But after, all the teams hang out visitors were welcomed and they all bonded. I have had SO many jobs where people are cutthroat, take customers from you or flat out rob from others and never seem to get that we were all are in a profession together. These ladies understand they're in a unique league, and that's amazing appreciation.","useful":5}

I don't think any of us were interested, but it was a sweet (literally sweet) gesture.\n\nWe all left feeling satisfied but not blown away...

Real wood paneling, yes real wood. Booths with real wood backing. They killed a couple of trees to build this place.

They made a pact to never change it so the past would be preserved for anthropologist to explore. \n\nThe entrance is in the back of the building/shack. There are signs warning of twenty four hour security camera surveillance and barbed wire around the windows in the back part of the building. This is to keep out the thugs who want to steel the priceless steaks, similar to security around places like? jewelry stores. Ah yes.

The salad was fresh and they let you assemble it yourself. This is a restaurant that has not reinvested in their future. They will sell the property to someone who will build a self storage business here and that will be the end. My rating is somewhat generous. A below average price/value proposition at this restaurant. \n\nI would consider other steak houses in the area for dining unless you want to go back in your time machine for an average meal.

It used to be a video poker bar that looked too intimidating for me to go into and was shut down for a while. I saw them put a dumpster out for several weeks and guys were picking the place apart. Eventually they put up some new, non-lit signage. On a side note, this was when golden Steer down the strip mall, decided the recession was bad enough to try and open for lunches, but that's getting ahead of my review for them. I must focus, huh?\n\nThere was a time on nights my g/f would work and I would have a night off, I would walk around the area for dinner or exploring. I missed the \"grand\" opening of the place, but this place looked inviting enough that I wandered in one night and there were only a few people at the bar. Inside looked clean and well lit at the bar area. The surprise was there were a couple of bartenders (as opposed to one bartender per every hundred customers) and someone setting up the DJ area for another connecting dancefloor room. \n\nI got a beer and checked out the plastic bar special promo cards and fliers on the bar and the bartender told me to help myself. There was a food setup behind where I was. Dude, you had me at FREE EATS. They had roasted garlic chicken and veggies and bread and things. I devoured that up, roller! \n\nThe bartenders were talking to this couple at the other end of the bar about their strategies of winning and something else. Damn it, I appear to be getting \"Saget Ted HIMYM memory gap,\" I hate that. But one thing you can always be sure of at a bar, listening to people's gambling strategies. I do listen to them, eventually something interesting comes out of it despite the fact that 97% of it is fluff and exaggeration. We all know, if the system worked, they wouldn't be sitting at a little bar off the strip. I would only take actual gambling advice from a Phil Hellmuth, Jean Scott or yes, a woman I met at MGM who I found out won the lottery back in her home state 4- FOUR times. I never told her I knew. She had very odd behaviors before I found out. Funny how someone's quirks become eccentricities when you find out they're rich. Or a porn star. \n\nSo one of the couple nails a 4 of a kind- confirming at least a competant level of their length of play to match their stories- and let's say a few rounds of drinks were given to all us around the bar! All 5 of us. Different mixed shots, for me that's a wow. Because it took me my 20's and most of my 30's- meaning all- to learn to not have more than 2 types of alcohol in one night or my stomach would become a bobsled race nobody wins. It either goes up or down, thru the goddamn fence. \n\nSo, in 4 hours we're all pals, telling stories and crying on each others shoulders, FUCK YOU, I love you maan. Guys are so bipolar on shotskis. I decided for one last beer to \"taper down\" and be on my merry. I said my goodbyes and checked out. My tab? 2 beers, $6. I paid more for the tip! \n\nSo, basically I had a buffet and 6 drinks for $15! I woulda paid over $30 for that experience. the magic of Vegas. A good long wlak some helped the sobering pro-cess. I went back many times after. while I heard about the vid poker couple coming in, I didn't see them again. The bartender knew me after, that's for sure.\n\nGood times roll!","useful":13}

I had a room that was on the sign from the elevator, the first room on the floor. From the window to the right I could see Paradise Rd. towards Hilton while they were building some new attraction for Star Trek fans that I would later attend the opening of on another trip & the week before that closed, as a local. \n\nMy trip was to meet a group of people who were fans of something that didn't have a name then, but now it would be an interactive websodic blog site. Sahara was undergoing construction & our big landmark by the lobby construction maze was a Red Dodge Viper you could supposedly win. That week was the U2 Pop Mart tour, which I found out too late. Too late because we were \"stuck\" in the casino the night of the concert, all of the taxis in town were dispatched to the concert somehow. I never thought to take the bus. This was long before the monorail, too. I think my trip was supposed to be for 4 days. I won so much money playing craps that I learned from annual weekend Reno bus trips, I was able to call back to work & somehow extend my vacation 3 more days. In retrospect, I have no idea how I pulled that off. My adrenaline was magic. I had a date that first weekend, an Arizona woman I met online months earlier from WBS chat. This World Wide Web thing got me to travel beyond the bay area & L.A. & see a world I never considered before with flashing lights, neon with no last calls.\n\nThat week I got around the strip, I saw a frame for a building with a huge ornament sticking out of the front. By the end of that week, I saw that it was supposed to look like some motorcycle jumping out of the front of what became Harley Davidson Cafe. I also tried out a club called The Beach that I wound up partying at for 3 new years eve's after.\n\nSahara had a $1 bar with beers & hot dogs that I remember used to be the Bra Bar, where women got hooked up when they gave it up. I remembered when the arcade used to have motion simulator movies besides the Nascar simulators. That was also a larger setup when it opened. I have many printouts from the simulator races, one was from a legendary trip with the guys & I can try to identify other printouts as using the sim as a \"sobriety test\" before driving my motorcycle home. \n\nOne of the few Sundays I had off I went down during Nascar to watch under RoadZilla. I bought a wristband & every time my driver was in the lead, we got a free shot. I won 5 more than \"too many\" free shots & got to meet a couple of girls who had a room upstairs, but they were locals & this was a longshot of a bonus to me. \n\nI met the Amazing Johnathan & Psychic Tanya & saw their show there for the first time. I got to see & meet them at a few other shows since with some of my friends that are performers. I never go to do the GM auto drive that was behind Sahara. However, lemmie give shout outs to Record City, PT's (East) & Leatherby's delicious ice creams nearby!\n\nI remember the 24 hour cafe well, used to be one of the best graveyard eats. I first noticed the $3 steak & egg breakfast I enjoyed for years was one of the first casualties of the worst recession of our time. I didn't see another $3 steak & egg special anywhere else since. \n\nOne of the last things we did was see that show with Buddy's kid performing as Joey Bishop, the most under appreciated member of The Summit at the Sands. That was a time, when all the shows had live orchestras. Sahara pioneered the late night lounges that had the top acts, all performing for free, all packing the house out to the hall. I'm sad that I won't get to House of Lords again, but I hope a Rat Pack's former hangout down the street will live on for more decades. \n\nMy last trip thru Sahara I'm not sure I remember because I didn't assume it would be my last. I lived off Sahara West by Palace Station & I got to walk thru Sahara from the monorail when I took it home from work. I got in a groove playing a bank of machines that according to a website paid out the most jackpots. I always at least got dinner out of it & a few beers when I partook on My Fridays.\n\nI hope by the time Vegas gets money to build casinos again, people will realize how a wannabe whaler non-themed douche attracting McCasino is what's keeping us blue collar folk away. Yeah, us that were repeat customers who's real bucketfulls of quarters (not BS tickets) built the casinos with years of loyalty until the new managers try to bump the place up a star. At least go for a vintage classy themed casino. Even Disneyland got smart & re-themed Tomorrowland to \"vintage future.\" My biggest hope is someone will get really smart & have a Vegas themed casino & replicate if not rescue from the boneyard a lot of the famous & infamous Nesco symbols of Vegas, from the Apache to Moulin Rouge, from the Sands to Hacienda, Silver Slipper to the Horseshoe.\n\nThey might as well change the street name back to San Francisco Ave.","useful":5}

Not many people were talking, so I broke the ice with some guy who looked pretty serious, like we were going to Talladega.

I had to get to know these people since I wanted someone to say \"he was a good guy\" when it came time to identify the body. \n\nWe heard the roar of engines as we circled the Speedway and went thru the tunnel to emerge inside it.

We got to an area to be briefed and RACE SUIT UP. The cars had a double cam setup, to look at the POV and us in the car. I would have cashed a bond, you're damn right I'm getting THAT footage. A pic was taken of us also that we got to buy later and I did that cause the plaque was pretty damn sweet. I wanted everything that showed proof of me doing it, like I was on the space shuttle, or Christy Canyon. \n\nYou know, I brought my own camera and like a complete dumbshit- there was less concept of time than in a casino- I didn't get any pics of me in the suit. I was rubbernecking everything, damnit. When would I ever get to do that again? CD video. \n\nLoaded into the car, I talked with my driver for a bit, it was like I was a 5 year old kid interviewing a fireman. They have driver training courses also, for a day to several weeks.  \n\nWe were off and I did that thing where you try to hold your hand in front of you. I tried it for a second before realizing I could shatter my arm if it got slammed around. \n\nWith a mic-ed headset on it was louder than F as he wound that bad boy up! Little did I know the conversation would be on the DVD, so you can really hear how ricockulous I was. I was on a drunk high goin the fastest I ever had in a car before, averaging speeds over 200MPH.

These are real Nascar cars and parts with the only modifications being a second seat and harness setup.

Those commercials about the casino seem to make people think that there are a lot of animals, bestiality and Aerosmith video extras hang out around the hotel doing all kinds of West German expressionist wackiness.\n\nClearly, the casino is not that. The lighting was strange. It was bright but the walls were black. It was kind of night clubby, but it had lots of glass/ plastic beads refracting light and colors all over. \n\nThe music alternated between funk and vintage Motown/ soul. Where do we sign the petition that top 40 easy listening music from the 80's has to be phased out of casinos? This casino gets it, creates a theme or a difference without announcing it's brand. \n\nI haven't been on the strip in some time, so when I did I made a conscious decision not to dwell on the past and what was gone. My mission was to carve off the lip of the newest things. Hashtag trendy.\n\nIn volleyball, when the ball comes over the net, the first to make contact has to slow the blast down, pop the ball up a little to set for the second person to spike it back over. Cosmo bumps a little on d√©cor, a little with music, a little with the art. It doesn't try to spike a return and overdo it like a few other 5 star wannabe casinos. \n\nIt's a little artsy, but doesn't over douche it. Locals recognize a bit of first Friday, eclectic art here and there and constantly new from the halls to the rooms to the parking structures. \n\nThe even have it to go in vending machines, which some people recognize as cigarette machines. And we get to think about there being a time when people had self discipline of when or when not to use such machines. \n\nEven the stores and restaurants don't over do the gimmicks, but there are noticeable things to check out: an oyster bar, live bikini models, the not really secret hidden pizza place. I purposely stopped listening about it so I could take my time and find it on my own, as if I taped the superbowl and had to block out any results til I got to see it myself. \n\nThe thing is, it's not just pretty stuff to look at, but there's a lot to actually do there. There's weird little elevators all over the place that look like time travel booths. I noticed them and thought what are they? There's no floor number above. Where do they go? They just end with nothing above it and we're not on the top floor? They beg to be taken to explore. It's not the generic bank of elevators. \n\nThey layout of the casino itself is unique and different. It reminded me of Beverly hills streets, the halls curve and wind and you're not really sure of even the direction you're going. My trick of not getting lost in a casino actually didn't work in this casino a couple of times. Wow. \n\nThe balcony views are expected to be wonderful, but the surprise it that they're so accessible, from walkways, some restaurants and bars. \n\nI did have one agenda when I came in, I know 4 people that work there. I went all over to the restaurants and bars where I knew they worked and could find no one. Bummer. \n\nFor a place that opened months ago, there are thousands of reviews and pictures. But there are dozens of pictures that aren't like any of the others. There's definitely a lot to take in as you wonder where this way goes.. \n\nCosmo is liked by locals and I was pleasantly impressed for a new casino. It takes a lot for a local to want to push their way thru fanny packers to get to a lounge or bar with any regularity on the strip. \n\nTo new drinking and dining aventures!","useful":2}

No vending machines selling soap and dryer sheets for forgetful people or emergencies. No TV, stereo or magazines. Nowhere to sit really, certainly no lounge, except for some dilapidated chairs in need of a Lysol wipe. There's a change machine, but it charges you $0.25 per use.

Also, there is no clock and none of those laundry bins on wheels for transporting your items from washer to dryer and from dryer to folding table.\n\n* No security or staff on hand. There were two characters loitering around the entrance the entire time I was doing laundry and they looked like they were either on their way to a bank heist or coming back from a kidnapping. All of the clothes that they washed had price tags on them and the conversation I overheard sounded like something out of Goodfellas. The one dude sounded like a cross between George Carlin and Al Pacino and had a Pomeranian named TINKERBELL. After seeing several other shady delinquent types walk in I doubt I'd leave my clothing unattended. Also, a woman who was drying her clothes in the machine next to mine smelled decidedly like urine. If I'm being honest, I come to the laundromat in the hopes that my clothes will come out smelling CLEAN and would rather not inhale the malodorous stench of piss while folding my tea towels. Thanks.\n\n* Pricey. $2.75 per wash or $6 for a double wash. $0.25 per five minutes of drying time. The dryer price is pretty standard but the wash is expensive. At least the wash is quick at 27 minutes per cycle.","useful":15}

Tables are scattered about along with cozier seating areas of armchairs and couches.  Decor is kitschy and includes a few smatterings of Christmas decor despite the fact that it's May.  Let's be festive, fine by me!   \n\nAt 11am on a Friday the place was bustling but tables were free without having to stalk (weekdays are probably the time to go, based on what I'm reading here... I never have the patience to deal with crowded shenanigans on a weekend).  Our food was ready in minutes and super tasty.  The Seitan Hash ($7.50) is served with marinated seitan (YUUUUM), potatoes & peppers along with a side of eggs & toast.  The Frittata ($7.50) was equally delish, nicely portioned (not overwhelmingly large) with fresh veggies and cheese on top.  Remember to load your plate up with any condiments (ketchup, jelly, etc) you may need before getting back to your table.  My only kvetch was that the jelly jars weren't labeled so I spent more time than the average bear trying to distinguish between red jams.  Cash only but overall things were quite reasonably priced, me thinks.  \n\nNote: they do switch over from the breakfast to the lunch menu at 11am  (weekdays only) and staff did go through the line to determine who was there for breakfast before they made the official lunch switch (which consisted of flipping menu chalk boards around and declaring it would be lunch-only once new folks wandered in.  Fair enough!  Baked goods were tasty as well and it appears on weekends there is a bakery annex (for to-go bakery goods) to alleviate some of the restaurant crush --annex open from 7am-11am/12pm, probably whenever they run out!    \n\nWhile I may not be brave enough to try my hand on a weekend, this is definitely a stop I'd add to my itinerary for weekday adventures.","useful":2}

I may hit the character limit (5000, FWIW). There is just so much to say...\n\nI don't even know where to begin. What DIDN'T I eat at Frida's tonight!? I was lured here by the promise of \"the best guacamole in Toronto\" and as an avocado enthusiast, how could I decline? \n\nYou're going to hear the words \"worth the trek to Bathurst & Eglinton\" a couple of times in this review, so just accept it: Frida's is worth the trek to Bathurst & Eglinton. In fact, it's right by Eglinton West station and the #63 Ossington bus took me right to it from all the way down on King Street in less than 40 minutes. During rush hour, no less. So just get over to Frida's, like, now.\n\nFrom the moment we sat down there was food on offer - complimentary housemade tortilla chips with salsa verde and another, hotter dipping sauce were brought out. Next came another surprise, a complimentary offering of a special mini tortilla with fried onion, cheese and salsa on top. \n\nI ordered a glass of white wine raspberry sangria ($9) and it was outstanding. I shan't order sangria again unless it's at Frida's - it was just really, really good and perfectly flavoured. \n\nNext came the famed guacamole ($8), which several people have claimed is \"the best in the city.\" IT'S THE BEST IN THE CITY. It's made fresh to order with avocados, red onions (omitted by request), tomatillos, cilantro and fresh lemon juice and served with arugula and more of those tasty, salty chips on the side. I found myself eating the arugula even though I had no idea I liked arugula in the first place. I just wanted to inhale everything that was presented to me!\n\nThen came the Papadzules Yucatecos ($13) - crumbled poached eggs (possibly quail? A small bird, to be sure), wrapped in corn tortillas with yucatecan tomato sauce, pumpkin seed pipian and green pumpkin seed oil. A mouthful, both in description, size and flavour. These corn tortillas were almost dosa-inspired and quite tasty. Loved the egg and pumpkin flavourings. \n\nAs an entree I ordered vegetarianized Tostadas ($18), served with cotija cheese (!!), refrito beans, pico de gallo, housemade sour cream (Dave O: \"they sour their own cream, for god's sake!\") and sliced avocado.\n\nWhat was most startling was the service. Our server, Derek, was among the most professional, courteous and knowledgeable servers I've ever encountered. He had the enthusiasm of a novice paired with the demeanour and professionalism of a veteran, yet looked quite young, so being the impulsive person that I am, I asked him his age - we had pegged him as being between 24 and 28. Imagine my shock (I gasped) when he told us he was only 20 years old.\n\nTWENTY! And waiting tables like a fucking champ, after only two weeks in the official position, no less. Derek knew the menu inside and out, was very descriptive and forthcoming with details about the menu items. He was attentive even when Frida's got busy with a few large groups, refilling waters, taking plates away, checking in on us, etc. The manager, Brenda, was also very kind and attentive and made sure everything was \"just right.\" It was so nice to hear about the care and detail that goes into the preparation of the food here - I mean quite frankly I can't remember the last time I was able to truly enjoy onion-less guacamole in a restaurant. Usually it's been sitting around for hours to the point that it's taken on a grey-ish hue. I could eat a vat of the guac at Frida's and the only thing (mercifully) stopping me from doing so is the short commute.\n\nWe also learned that they serve brunch on Sundays from 10:30-2pm. Took a glance (OK, an ogle) at the menu and saw more huevos, omelette and taco options than I could ever imagine possible.\n\nAfter all that food, dessert was an impossibility. Whoever said Toronto has no good Mexican food clearly hasn't been to Frida's.\n\nReservations are recommended. Will be back, pronto.","useful":22}

The only drawback to the entire meal was that the server told us that the mac-and-cheese plate was big enough for a meal, but when it came, it was actually pretty small (perfect size for a starter). Husband insisted that it was just enough, but I would have preferred he have a bigger main course. But I digress.\n\nExpect to pay upwards of $50/person if you go all out and order wine, starters, and entrees, but this could easily be an affordable dinner at happy hour or if you just get a few starter plates to share. The portions are adequate, but not really big enough to take home leftovers.\n\nI can't wait to go back to sample some more wine and cheese!","useful":3}

I looked at the clock and saw it was 5:30pm... I knew Jared would be home soon and hungry for dinner, and since I told him I'd make us something I ran out to the store.  Sick of the Safeway up the street, I decided to try Fry's instead.  I'd been in once before but I didn't remember it being as bad as it felt today.\n\nFirst of all, I didn't feel safe (even in the broad daylight) as I got out of my car and walked into the store.  It not only felt dirty, but the people around me were not people that I felt comfortable around.  My gut must've been right, because I noticed there was at least one security guard hanging out by the door.\n\nI held my purse and cell phone close to my body as I shopped, walking by a few people with body odor and not making eye contact with anyone.  The food selection at this location is meh, but I managed to find what I was looking for... some eggs, chicken breasts, spinach, as well as an additional $20 worth of random sh*t that I didn't anticipate buying today. (Am I the only one that does this?  I do this all of the time - I walk in with a grocery list of 5 items and walk out with 20!)  But I digress...\n\nThe thing that takes Fry's down from a 3 star review to a 2 star review is the annoying thing that you only get the special Fry's pricing if you have a Fry's card.  Usually, the check-out person has a spare card they can run for you, but today that was not the case.  Since I have at least two Fry's cards already (that of course I left at home or in another purse or something), I didn't want to take yet another one... so I had to bother the gentleman behind me to borrow his.  (Thank goodness he said yes, as it did save me $5!)  \n\nSo, needless to say, I've definitely experienced better food stores than this specific Fry's location.  (I happen to love the Fry's Super Stores by the way so it's nothing against Fry's as a company - just this specific store).  Next time I'm in need of some quick groceries, I'll be heading elsewhere.

The hostess said it would be a few minutes, so we sat at a table in the lounge area, ordered some drinks, and snacked on some of the wasabi peas.  The waitress that took our cocktail orders was sweet, and she made some great Taojitos for the group!  At 8:30, we were wondering why we had to wait so long and getting a bit ansy... we finally were taken to our table around 8:40.\n\nDinner was amazing once we were seated.  Chris was our server and took great care of us.  We enjoyed a round of appetizers including lobster dumplings, crispy tuna tataki, edamame, duck spring rolls, and eggplant tempura.  We also did dinner family style and shared wasabi steak, pad thai with shrimp, crispy snapper, seafood in black bean sauce, spicy eggplant, curry shrimp tempura maki, and pork fired rice.  It's two days later, and I am writing this all from memory - it was that good!  (Usually I would have to look back at the menu to remember what we ordered, but it all made a lasting impression in this case).  We literally cleaned all of the plates - everything was great, and quick too!\n\nLuckily, even with all of that food, we saved room for dessert.  Chris brought out a beautiful birthday cake for the birthday girl and boy (my bro and sis are twins).  I'm talking really quality, beautiful gourmet cake (like AJ's in AZ).  It had \"Happy Birthday A & Z\" written on it in chocolate and it was a vanilla layer cake of sorts.  \n\nI didn't pay the bill, and I'm sure it was expensive, but this was by far the best meal we had on the trip, and I'm sure it was worth it!

I opted for the sandwich, which ended up being more of an open-faced flatbread with stacked veggies and (a bit too much) cheese.

Some people would be bothered by this, but I laughed.  Once, I took a client who had a bit too much to drink, I guess.  When we were seated, he was looking at the chopsticks that were balancing against a rock and asked the waitress if the rock was intended as a tool to get her attention.  She didn't laugh.  Instead, she chose to tell our entire table, \"Not unless you want me to spit in your food.\"  Not too professional for such a highly regarded restaurant, but then again he was being a dumbass.\n\nOn to the food.  Yes, it is amazing.  No, I cannot tell you why.  Everything I have ever tasted here was exceptional.  The price is the only negative.  The toro nigiri is to die for even at $20 a piece, or whatever it was.  I once ordered three Kobe beef appetizers for a group.

There are a few tables indoors and then a picnic table and small patio area but I'd say the capacity of the whole place is 30 people at most. \n\nThe Mitzi's spot has existed since 1905 and when it first opened it was a grocery store that sold milk for $0.15, later renamed \"Sorauren Grocery\" and then \"Superior Groceries & Meat.\" It became Mitzi's Caf√© in 1996. \n\nThere are no paper menus and the selection is limited to about seven or eight breakfast items that are outlined on a chalk board. I ordered the poached eggs (my favourite!) on spiced black beans with tomatillo salsa, sour cream, lime salted tortilla chips and home fries ($13.95). Absurdly pricey for breakfast/brunch but at least the portions are big. \n\nThe poached eggs were perfectly cooked and the spicy black bean mixture was ungodly good. The potatoes were smothered in some sort of savoury sauce that tasted a smidge like tamarind but the server couldn't confirm it as it's a \"secret recipe that only two people know.\" I was personally not a fan of the tomatillo salsa but it may have been psychosomatic - I just couldn't get past the pale green/snot-like colour. It sort of reminded me of relish, and really, who likes relish?\n\nService is on the slow side despite the ample staffing and small number of patrons - I got the impression by today's visit that a lot of the customers are locals and regulars, so it makes for a lot of chatting/catching up that results in less attentive service. It took so long to get our bill sorted I felt like perhaps I had missed a memo about paying at the counter or something.\n\nCash only.","useful":10}

The other is Mill Street's retail store in the Distillery District, and they (obviously) only carry tasty Mill Street beer. You can't get Mill Street gets at The Beer Store (even though you can buy bottles/cases).

Obviously you'd go for the 50L since it's nearly twice the volume and 30% more money. Call ahead to place your order and let them know when you're coming to pick it up. They'll give you a hand pump for the keg, and you should definitely get two of these just in case your pump breaks five minutes before your party.** And also because as mentioned, the only other place in Toronto that carries hand pumps is the faraway Bathurst/Dupont Beer Store. \n\nThere's a $50 deposit that you get back when you return the empty keg, usually recommended within a few days. In other words, don't worry about having to haul ass to Mill Street the morning after your rager.\n\nRetail store manager Lauren was very kind and helpful with all my cluelessness when I called to order my kegs.

In fact, I like it better than their First Markham Place sibling. They offer both the regular-sized XLBs and the mini ones.  My kids love the latter, but I still prefer the standard size ones as the smaller ones don't seem to be as juicy or meaty.  Also tried their green onion pancakes, wonton soup, red bean bun, stir fried bokchoy and siu mai (yum!).  \n\nService also is a little better here, as with the location and ambiance.

When we made the plans, we said we'd figure out the time and place as the date approached.  So when my friend suggested we go to FnB, I hesitated for a moment...\n\n\"What is FnB,\" I asked? (Embarrassed that I had no clue).\n\n\"It's the new restaurant located where Sea Saw and Digestif used to be,\" my friend informed me.\n\n\"OK - Perfect,\" I responded - still having no clue what to expect.\n\nJared and I were fans of Digestif and ironically, we happened to be there on the last night they were open.  We went in for dinner on Sunday, October 18th (the day after our wedding) and were shocked to hear the news... But enough about that!\n\nIn just six weeks time, this restaurant transformed into FnB, the creation of Pavle Milic and Chef Charleen Badman.  It now has a bit more space and a warmer, lighter feeling to it... the tile on the floor is really unique and colorful.  You can tell it's a family-run business too... we felt extremely welcome from the moment we set foot inside and we met the entire staff, Emily, Josh, Pavle, Chef Charleen, and Sous Chef Sasha.\n\nBut enough about the atmosphere and the fantastic staff, I'm sure you want to know about the food!\n\nThe menu is limited, but pretty much everything on it is appealing.  Luckily, our table was up for sharing.  We started with two orders of the crispy rock shrimp & jalapeno tartar and a fried green tomato salad.  Both were delicious... I especially enjoyed the combination of the fried green tomatoes with green goddess dressing and feta.  \n\nWe continued with the citrus marinated olives as an appetizer to share... they aren't kidding with the \"citrus\" description - you can really taste it and I loved it!\n\nJared and I shared the boneless trout entree and our companions shared the roast jidori chicken entree and we all shared an order of the spigarello.  What's spigarello? It's similar to broccoli rabe but not quite as bitter.  Chef Charleen prepares it with garlic and chili and it's delicious!  Needless to say, we cleaned all of our plates!\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, we proceeded to order one of each of the dessert offerings: a lemon creme brulee, an apple crisp, and the cherry chocolate bread pudding that Angela mentioned in her review.  The lemon brulee and the bread pudding were the favorites at our table.  And from listening to Pavle talk about it, I think the chocolate bread pudding is his favorite too!\n\nOh, and I forgot to mention that I was the only drinker in our group last night... I had a glass of sauvignon blanc - one from Chile - and it was perfect.\n\nThe prices aren't bad considering everything used at this restaurant is bought fresh daily from local farms.  We'll be back to see our friends at FnB again soon... and I encourage you to go check out this little gem of a restaurant as well!  Just make sure to save us a seat at the bar.","useful":16}

I shared a Caesar Salad to start, and that was quite tasty as well.  I was debating what to order for the main course and when I asked the waitress about the salmon she said she didn't eat seafood but that she's been told the salmon is 'buttery.'  Buttery salmon?  Really?  That didn't sell me on ordering the salmon, but it was what I went with after all.  And although I would not describe it as buttery, I will say it was good.  It was a generous serving as well, so I didn't mind when Jared started eating it off my plate.  The rice with veggies that it was served with was also tasty.\n\nOverall, Blanco didn't blow me away, but I am sure I'll return sometime.

I'm not saying I'm anticipating getting a fungal infection from this place, but unlike some salons where they use a fresh kit of nail files and emory boards on you, this place doesn't. Also, some of their equipment looks a bit run down and in need of replacement.\n- Cash only\n\nI'm torn between giving this place a 3 or a 4 because to be honest, I've had cheaper manicures before and the hygiene and lack of glamour of the \"salon\" (I use the term salon loosely here - really it's just a room) leave a little to be desired, but my nails look really, REALLY good and I've been getting compliments on them from really random people. 3.5?\n\nIt's been three days since the mani and I've been doing a lot of manual labour (moving furniture, cooking, opening things, typing) yet my nails still look perfect!

Oregano's is one of the only places I've been to that allows you to mix their wing sauces.

It's sort of like sex but only a chicken wing. \n\nI feel like I hear people bitch about the price a lot but to me, it's pretty much perfect for what you get.  It's a littler pricier than a place like Streets of New York, but the service and food is better, it's a little less than somewhere like Pizzeria Bianco or Le Grande Orange, but again, it's a little less, you know, delicious as those places.  It's also a great place to take out of town folk since it's a local chain, yet always consistent and generally there is something everyone will like.\n\nPersonally, I don't mind the long waits for a table on the weekends.

And instead of being cynical wondering when the bricks will fall on her, I actually like the newbie's point of view. I had a lot more hope of things when I moved here. It is a tough time. It's so easy to look on how we got out of recession in the past, but the truth is, we don't know what to believe in the media. Or why spend the time looking? Why would it be easier to believe things will get worse and over question flickers of things on the rise?

Look for the clip online, infamous recording of Casey having a breakdown with what he has to read on the air. Darren must have vowed he would NEVER get caught in this situation.

He's all over the social networking sites also, which I suppose is alright. The 4th announcer is Stefanie Jay and there is a bit of sexual tension when they banter off each other.

I don't have much room in my dining life for terrible service. Within seconds of sitting down we were urged to order appetizers, yet we hadn't even been provided with menus. When I saw a nearby table snacking on steamed edamame, I decided to order it, only to be told that they don't have edamame on the menu. English was very limited so I didn't have the energy to argue. \n\nI ordered the \"orochong ramen\", and thankfully one of my dinner mates spoke Korean and was able to request a vegetarianized version. I honestly feel like whenever I eat at an Asian restaurant I am at the mercy of the chefs when it comes to respecting my dietary preferences. I can never be sure if what I'm eating is truly vegetarian. It's a real trust thing. \n\nThe food was piping hot and the portion was ample. It was a little spicy for my tastes (and I like spicy food) and I was only able to finish about 1/5th of my meal. Despite this, the server didn't once ask if anything was wrong with my food or if I wanted to take it to go. It just sat in front of me, untouched, until after I had left. Apparently one of my dinner mates DID ask to have her food wrapped up and never saw it again. I wouldn't return.\n\nCash only.","useful":13}

We did that the next day, on a Wednesday.  I dropped Minnie off in the morning and picked her up that evening.  I was told that Minnie did well and that hopefully results from the testing would come back by that Friday.

But today Dr. Gilson called to say that the mass is benign - thank goodness!  He now wants to do an ACL surgery, which he says is very common amongst dogs.

The ambiance is nice, good lighting, lots of windows, & white tablecloths.  Our server was friendly enough but seemed to miss a few key service points (i.e., entrees for different people coming out with big time gaps between them, just dropping off the check aon the table towards the end of the meal, before we were even finished & not asking if we wanted anything else, dessert, a box for leftovers, etc).  \n\nMy initial disappointment happened as I perused the menu and realized the lack of vegetarian options.  Out of perhaps 10 appetizers only two were vegetarian - sticky rice and thai spring rolls. The spring rolls were okay but seemed to be missing some flavor/veggies, heavy on the clear noodles. They also came out on one plate with a dipping sauce but we weren't given any individual appetizer plates to accompany this.\n\nFor entrees, there also weren't a lot of vegetarian options, which I think is unusual for a Thai restaurant. There were several different versions of pad thai (different noodles seemed to be the major difference) that could be ordered with tofu and then there was one curry you could order with tofu. Besides that, everything seemed to have meat in it. If you wanted to try to get a special-request veg dish made, there were \"chicken\" and \"beef\" menu headings that listed things like \"beef & mixed vegetables\". I asked our server if we could replace the meat with tofu and she seemed to think this could work but it was clear it hadn't been a consideration in menu creation.\n\nThe entrees were ordered were good (the curry) and ok (the pad thai). The curry was flavorful and was a nice portion and chock full of veggies & tofu. The pad thai was ordered spicy & came out mild and seemed to be heavy on the noodles. \n\nAll in all, it wasn't as good as I'd hoped for but I'll wait a few weeks/months and give it another shot. I just hope they work out the service kinks and recognize that they need to either add a vegetarian section to the menu or at least more options and perhaps split the menu so it's clear what is Cambodian & what is Thai.","useful":1}

If you have a car & map a route just right, you can hit another location before you finish the Slurpee from your last & do that all day. I don't have a vehicle, but dare to dream.\n\nI used to live near this sev yo (not the sketchy apartments across the street), so it was my default. It was also my bus stop to Sahara monorail stop for a couple of years. I spent many days sitting out there thinking about what to do about the job that was killing my spirit, making me stressed. It built more frustration from the inhumanity I witnessed on a daily basis with rude, demanding tourists. Imagine those were the happy days before my unemployment. \n\nI tried reading one of those \"Don't Sweat The...\" books at the stop & disagreed with most of the advice. it wasn't about how to stop the problem or teach people the error of their ways. Most of the advice was to be an enabler, allowing people to live their greedy, rude & inconsiderate lives while you took it all, bottled it up to diffuse later, on \"my own time!\" No. That's what corporate America is, that's what working in retail is. \n\nNo wonder some of these people always look like they're ready to snap the second you say anything. I've been at my retail hell, for as long as I could manage. That was already my \"just take it, it's a job\" job. & I was looking for better one within a month. I have no idea how the clerks at 7-eleven maintained, I saw them put up with a lot of things. But their customers get a quick snack & are out of there, they're not browsing all day. \n\nI made a rule that I wouldn't take my work anger back to my own doorway. I spent nights walking the length of the strip just to blow off steam & calm down. The older parts of north strip reminded me why I moved there. By the time I got home, I was just numb, sore & sad. But the happiest part of my day was my cat welcoming us home & holding my g/f as we tried to asleep. I collected all the Domo Slurpee cups for her, it's one of her favorites. \n\nThis location had a Grand (re)opening that I couldn't enjoy more because I only knew of it as I was going to work. They had a stage setup with singers & musicians. They were handing out balloons & things to kids. There was a smattering of about 20 people in the hot sun. I always think about grand openings, fairs & festivals. I think about parents looking to take their little kids someplace for these free publicity events for something to do on a hot summer day. I spent a lot of my childhood going to 7-eleven getting ice creams & Slurpees with my aunt & cousin, downtown San Jose.\n\nWhy couldn't we do this every day or even every week? I always imagined having a business where I could have fireworks every week, a concert stage, huge inflatable animals & those air people with long flappy arms, food stands, drawings, prizes. Even theme parks don't do that, they don't have community groups, they outsource to big companies. & county fairs aren't year round. \n\nAt the hot bus stop in summer, there's a small brick wall behind that's in the shade of the power line pole. I would stand behind the wall & realize that I was Charlie Brown or Linus thinking about life. I even realized it was comfortable, left hand to right elbow, right hand under cheek. I always wondered what they were looking at.\n\nI'd have to go 7-eleven as a necessary spending evil to get change for the bus. Often I'd get a sausage muffin or breakfast burrito to scarf on the monorail. You could eat on that, not the bus which is strange. The bus has staff/ a driver on it to regulate if you litter. \n\nThere are a lot of things in the area I've seen or have to Yelp about. I never got to check out that Korean BBQ place nearby I saw every day. But somehow, I saw the Oscar Meyer Weinermobile in front twice & I tried to think of more than one connection. Palace station of course, one of my favorites. I discovered Landry's & even applied there. Dinner in the Sky was a new attraction that I had to promote when I worked in a Strip Hotel, I got to know one of the managers & his girl in booking. At night I heard people laughing & dining about 40' up, held by a crane. The area smelled like fries cut fresh from the in-n-out. Once, I had to get change from 7-eleven in my Halloween costume.\n\nSure, 7-eleven jacks up their prices & you pay for the \"convenience.\" But they are open whenever you need them.

It's Mexican food after all, which we all know is supposed to be cheap.\n\nIf you want to pay this price for 'gourmet' Mexican food, I would have to say that Lindo Michoacan is better.  However, you have to factor in the cab fare too and from this off-strip property, unless you have a car.\n\nMy favorite thing, and the most memorable, was the selection of salsas that they offer with your meal.  I remember liking all three on my first visit and a different set of 3 on my second visit.  They seem to have it down in this department.  The bar also has a great selection of drinks and tequilas.

He took his time getting to know me, my medical history, etc... before giving me a full exam and scheduling an echo cardiogram with Suzie who was also great and made me feel at ease as she looked and listened closely to my heart.\n\nI'm happy to report that while I do indeed have an irregular heartbeat (which is likely related to being prego), Dr. Klassen is not too concerned and it's supposedly not anything for me to stress out about too much.

Most recently, I went for lunch on a beautiful Sunday afternoon.  My BF and I sat outside and enjoyed the fresh air and beautiful view of the Rancho Manana Golf Course as we dined.  \n\nI will agree with Francesca that this is a rustic but extremely classy restaurant.  It's warm and cozy inside and has the feel of a lodge but serves higher end cuisine... \"all natural\" meats and a variety of fresh salad, soups, veggies, breads, and desserts prepared daily.  I recently learned that Tonto uses many native AZ products and supports the Native SEARCH seed program (whatever that is but it sounds really great).\n\nBack to my Sunday afternoon lunch...\nAfter taking a while to peruse the menu and enjoying a fine basket of fresh bread and butter, we decided to share a large Cowboy Cobb Salad with Lemon Herb Vinaigrette and Crumbled Bleu Cheese.  The salad came with chicken, bacon, egg, tomato, cucumber, and an avocado fan on top.  It was the perfect size for 2 to share and they split it in the kitchen for us which made it easy.  Since we were hungry we each ordered a side item as well.  I had the acorn squash - it was seasoned just right and melted in my mouth... I would order it again and again - it tasted like candy!  I think Jared was envious of the squash since he kept coming back for more.  He ordered the barley and mushroom risotto as a side and he enjoyed it but it didn't compare to the acorn squash.\n\nService was pretty good although our side items were not brought out until at least 10 minutes after our salad.  The view of the golf course made up for that easily, as did the fact that we were in no rush. \n\nIn past visits, I've tasted the salmon, scallops, and grouper as well as several of the veggies.  I love that the menu has so many options to choose from... there is something for everyone from the meat and potato lover to the strict vegetarian.

I'll keep my fingers crossed they're simply not done, because I feel like it still needs a dash more character and a touch of warmth.

The food menu is limited (translation: not a place you should necessarily expect a giant dinner, but certainly offers good drink accompaniments); everything I've had has been good.  The just-baked pretzels ($4) were piping hot although the mustard dip was heavy on the horseradish -- some people loved it but it  was a bit too spiiiicy for me.  (Admittedly, I'm a wimp.)  The deviled eggs ($5) were a nice treat and went over well, eight halves offering four different fillings ranging from traditional to cowboy to pulled pork.  My favorite was the grilled cheese ($6) which was a smaller sandwich (don't expect a ginormous dinner) but just the size I needed and enjoyable with crispy bread, grilled onions and a sweet tomato spread. \n\nThe pool table is gone but board games are in.  The new layout offers more open space and multiple cut-outs to allow you to peek into the brewery zone in the back and check out the process.

I requested a deep tissue massage for myself.  I was pleased that they called the day before to confirm our appointments.  We checked in about an hour before our scheduled massages and the lady looked at us both and asked \"so, you both have prenatal massages, correct?\"\n\nWHAT?  NO!  I looked down at my belly and said - nope - she has a prenatal massage and I requested a deep tissue massage.  Not a huge deal and probably not the girl's fault, but that is not a mistake to make to someone who is weight-conscious and far from prego!\n\nNo big deal... we're here to enjoy and relax.  Deep breath, Gabi... :)\n\nSo we are given a tour of the facility (which is beautiful, peaceful, tranquil, etc...) and we decide we have time for a walk before our massages.  So, we go outside and make our way around the hotel a bit.  There is a bunch of construction, so we turn around and go through the hotel and try to go to the back pool area to check it out.  Nope... the pool attendant says that spa guests cannot enter that pool area (not even for a walk) - you must be a hotel guest to enter.  OK then, we turn around and head back to the spa.\n\nWith about a 1/2 hour before we need to be ready for our massages, we decide to get in a quick workout in the fitness center.  It is clean, spacious for a hotel facility, and has all the equipment you need.  This was a positive, as was the actual spa pool and jacuzzi, sauna, etc...\n\nOnce we are in our robes and slippers, we head upstairs for our treatments - the waiting room is very well-done with comfy couches, chairs, blankets, plenty of magazines, relaxing music, and lots of treats (fruit, tea, water, trail mix, etc.)\n\nThe services didn't blow either of us away and for what we paid, we each could've gotten 4 massages each at Massage Envy instead.  But, again, it was about the day as a whole and the spa experience.  \n\nSo, we enjoyed a lovely lunch from the Spa Bistro and sat out by the pool in the afternoon.

We used to have dark chocolate meetups in my office area, where a few of my fellow aficionados would congregate and nerd out over new varieties we'd find, constantly trying to outdo the next person. \n\nI rushed into Domino Foods on the hunt for a 70-75% dark with blueberry or raspberry bits that was already divvied up into squares. I saw a paltry selection of Lindt dark chocolate by the cash and asked the owner if there was anything else. She urged me to go further into the store, where she unveiled a monstrous shelving unit teeming with chocolate. \"I'm very sorry,\" she apologized. \"We don't have much in stock after the holiday rush. I really do apologize.\"\n\nReality: I have never seen more chocolate than what was contained on these shelves. I'm actually scared to go back and see the store fully stocked.\n\nAt least forty different brands, a spectrum of cocoa percentages for dark chocolate from 40% all the way up to 99%, and dozens of countries represented. Valrhona, Green & Blacks, Amano, Ritter Sport, Endangered Species, Ghirardelli - all the usual suspects were there. There was every sort of fruit combination imaginable, plus multiple coffee varieties, individually wrapped squares, party packs and more. It was absolutely overwhelming, but I think I've found my jam: wafer thin strips of Perugina Nero Sfoglie in 88%. Irresistibili, just like the package promises.","useful":8}

We've been together much longer than I could expect any relationship to last. I've always taken a Pete Doherty approach to relationships - fuck forever: I tell my friends, if I can have a solid 10 years with one person, that's a great run and more than anyone can ask for these days. So it's been a blast, but regrettably it's time for me say goodbye.\n\nWe've certainly had our ups and downs. In fact, it's been quite turbulent. Loyalty is one of my specialties and sticking by you throughout was a true test of this loyalty.\n\n\"But it's so pretentious, the no substitutions policy at Terroni! It's barbaric!\" they'd declare. No matter - I continued to namedrop you when friends sought out birthday and other celebratory dinner venues. I fiercely defended your refusal to allow any changes to your \"the way we intend food to be served\" menu. \n\n\"But they refuse to take a reservation for my group unless it's for more than 6 people, between 5-6pm, and an odd-numbered day in June with Scorpio rising and Mars in Cancer.\" Just go, I'd say. The wait will be worth it, and you never really have to wait THAT long. \n\n\"But they're closed on Sundays. What kind of restaurant closes on Sundays?\" That's why there are three locations, I'd say. Make the trek to Yonge and St. Clair and don't worry about it. It'll be worth it. \n\n\"But they refuse to cut my pizza into slices!\" OK, you've got me there. But isn't the pizza great?\n\nI could only afford to visit your locations 3-4 times a month, but I was loyal to you for nearly ten years. Your reign as top dog in my restaurant black book ended last night at approximately 8:33pm ET.\n\nWe called you on Friday to inquire about a reservation for fifteen people on a Sunday. You told us you didn't take reservations, but to call ahead and you'd start preparing our table. \"It'll be fine,\" you lied. \"Just come on in.\"\n\n6:55pm ET: Your hostess took our names down and my friend, who was celebrating his 30th birthday that day and had impressively coerced his \"I don't go north of Bloor\" collection of friends into gathering at Yonge and St. Clair, told us the wait wouldn't be long, but looked visibly anxious. \n\n7:35pm ET: Your manager told us \"It won't be long now - there's a large party that's already paid and we're just waiting for them to leave. Should be any moment now - no more than five minutes.\" This was the last update we received as we all stood crowding the front entrance and watched table after table have their name called.\n\n8:00pm ET: At this point everyone was antsy, having fasted for the entire day in anticipation of our celebratory feast. A few of us ordered coffees at the bar and the server told us, \"We're preparing a sweet table for you.\" A few people asked for an update, and the hostess/manager told us that she wouldn't ask the large party to hurry or leave - fine. We asked her to entice them with a round of drinks on us - perhaps they could move their party to the bar? She refused. \n\n8:33pm ET: I hovered and seethed. How was it that nearly an hour had passed since the \"we should be seating you within 5 minutes\" update, with not so much as an apology, an appeasement or even an amendment to the original promise. So nearly 90 minutes of waiting in total. My issue wasn't with the length of time waited (we knew we'd have to wait) but the way we were treated.\n\nThen there was a small altercation with the hostess/manager that I shan't repeat because it made me so angry. Let's just say it involved some interference by famished and flustered patrons, the utterance of \"Don't talk to my customers. That's my job.\" and further ignoring.\n\nIt's that sort of \"fuck you\" attitude that I don't appreciate, and finally led our group to pick up and take our business elsewhere. I should have heeded the telling sign that only three reviews had been written on this location in all of 2009, and none of them positive.\n\nNever again, Terroni. \n\nI have a new Italian boyfriend now and he'll happily prep southern-style, home cooked food for me to my preferences. It'll be at a fraction of the inflated cost without an extra helping of pretension and gestapo-like enforcement. He'll let me dip my bread in olive oil AND balsamic vinegar if I want to, goddammit, he'll put parmagiano reggiano on any dish I want, not just the ones that the chef thinks should have it, AND he'll cut my pizza into fucking slices.\n\nWith love and fondness,\nKat F.\n\n** YTMND reference (watch with volume): http://youmakemetouchyourhandsforstupidreasons.ytmnd.com","useful":51}

While in my gut, I knew that the first one never recovered fully the way I would have liked, I still went back for the second one as I didn't know better. Now I do...\n\nBoth surgeries that Minnie had at SVS ended up getting infected (when it's extremely rare for even one \"clean\" surgery to get infected), and over a month later, we're still dealing with treating the infection the second one caused.  Minnie hasn't put any weight on her leg since then, which is likely causing even more issues.  \n\nI ended up going to another specialist recently to get a second opinion on what was going on and why the recovery is so slow this time, and I was blown away at how much more professional the staff was at this other office, how clean the office was, how much time the vet spent examining my dog, how detailed they were with follow-up, etc... (I'll put all of that in their review).\n\nSo, the bottom line is now that I've seen another board certified vet for my dog's knee issues, I'm having major regrets for going here in the first place, spending all of the time and money that I did, etc... if only hindsight were 20/20.  So, while I thought Minnie was in good hands at SVS initially, I can now confidently say that we've experienced way better.  My advice? Do your due diligence and research before settling on SVS (or any vet for that matter).  After all, our pets are our family and deserve the very best!","useful":24}

After a terrible rain delay at the ballpark and zero food, my husband and I were soaking wet, tired, irritated, and starving.  Enter: Great Taste.  We searched Yelp for the nearest Chinese joint once we entered the car and Great Taste was it.  It's a few blocks south of the ballpark so it's within walking distance.  \n\nWe stopped in for takeout around 9:45 p.m. because we just wanted to get back to our Airbnb and relax with our dinner.  They had a huge menu that included lunch and dinner specials.  We both ordered one of the dinner combos: Mongolian beef and sweet and sour chicken.  Both specials came with an egg roll (you can ask for a veggie one if you like, which I did).  \n\nLike other reviewers, the food was kind of bland.  I'm used to Mongolian beef having a strong soy/teriyaki flavor and this didn't really do it for me.  The beef was also a *bit* fatty, but maybe that had to do with the time of day we were ordering.  My husband's sweet and sour chicken was a bit better but the pieces were a bit soft.  I wish I had ordered that instead of my selection.  The egg roll was good but you have to grab your own sweet and sour sauce if you're a takeout customer, which I didn't do, so I was sad and didn't eat all of it.\n\nThis was a decent place to order from.  Not the best Chinese food I've ever had, but certainly not the worst.  They have a buffet during the day which might be awesome so try that.  The takeout was quick in coming (we only waited like 10 minutes) and everyone was really nice.","useful":3}

They happily accepted me as a walk-in at the low price of $12 (ie free).\n\nMy manicurist didn't speak English (like, not a word of it) but she was busy removing the last remains of my Ten Spot mani anyway. There wasn't much to clean up but it was a dark polish so it took a few swipes. She actually got remover all over my hands but cleaned it up afterwards.\n\nCUTICLE WORK/MISHAPS:\nGood cuticle work. My nails were already at their shortest limits so there was no filing or buffing required.\n\nHAND MASSAGE:\nVery good. Still not the best I've received but she had strong, firm hands and gave my hands an adequate rubdown. Hand cream smelled terrific.\n\nPOLISH APPLICATION:\nApplication was well done and required very few touchups. I had to prompt her to fix a few spots that she should have noticed/inspected on her own, but my hands looked great after the fix. She went right to the cuticle and every single spot on my nails had polish on it (which is not the case after some manicures). I sat under the hand dryer for about ten minutes and received some help when pulling out my wallet to pay. At $12 for a mani and $28 for a mani/pedi (at the time I went), this is affordable as a weekly option!\n\nPOLISH DURATION:\nHere's what brought this place from 2.5 or 3 stars to 4. After 8 days, my polish is still largely intact with only a few chipped nails. How is this even possible?? I washed more dishes this week than ever, collapsed a bunch of moving boxes and even did some crafting. I'm impressed!\n\nEXTRA NOTES:\n* Polish selection was good - OPI and China Glaze. \n* Lots of walk-ins and people buying gift certificates. They have another location on King Street West.\n* I almost got into a fistfight with another customer after she repeated for the umpteenth time \"When you have white lines on your nails, that means you're lacking in calcium. I'm calcium deficient. I don't drink enough milk. That's what the wine lines are from.\" No, bitch, that's not what they're from - stop perpetuating that myth. She wouldn't shut up about it and I wanted to lunge across the table and throttle some sense into her. A zinc deficiency, maybe, or maybe she just banged her nails on something, got too many manicures or handled too many damn pickles.***\n\n** Remember that show?? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIJYfvN9954\n*** http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/643/what-causes-white-spots-on-your-fingernails","useful":3}

Olbrich Gardens is a fun place to visit for both locals and out of towners.  The gardens are lovely and admission is FREE. Be sure to walk all the way through the gardens so you get to see the Thai Pavilion which is a pretty impressive structure.\n\nA lovely thing to do in the winter (or summer, I suppose, but definitely winter) is to visit the indoor Bolz Conservatory.  Warm, humid and tropical, it's fun to check out all the different plants and read the educational signage (which does rotate so you can expect something new).  Admission is only $2 or if you go Wednesday or Saturday mornings (10-12) it's free.\n\nUgh, now let's get to the grand prize winner for \"event most in need of improvement\".  The Cocktails in the Conservatory event sounds great in theory - come explore the Conservatory at night, there will be a DJ, lights, and cocktails!  This event appears to be hosted every other month and admission is $6.  I met up with a group here last Friday and the only way I could describe it is a fiasco. Doors opened at 7pm. By 7:30 they were \"at capacity\" and people were still streaming into the building. At this point they set up a line in the lobby to get into the Conservatory but it was a one-in one-out system. \n\nGiven that the crowd had just gotten there at 7pm, nobody was leaving anytime soon.  To make matters worse, there did not appear to be anyone actually officially and methodically checking people out so plenty of people seemed to come out, visit the bar in the lobby, grab their coats, leave unnoticed, and nobody else was allowed in.  Mind you, they have a ton of space in the building (a whole banquet room for weddings) so really they should probably take advantage of all this space and have the DJ / lights / speakers / bar in there and let people wander in/out of the Conservatory.  OR sell tickets ahead of time so people know if they're \"in\" and otherwise the event can be \"sold out\" ahead of time.  We hung out in line (not realizing how this scene was actually working) until 8:30 and then gave up and left. \n\nYou just have to picture this scene -- when we left (after an hour of waiting) the same people remained at the front of the line and the line behind us snaked 100+ people and extended all through the ballroom.  Cars still cruised into the parking lot, people were dropped off in cabs trying to get in, staff stood outside telling people they weren't even letting people into the lobby at this point.  Oy vey!  \n\nSo let's just say this event has become \"overly successful\".  Unless you plan on arriving at 7pm on the nose or they recognize some way to correct this issue, I would not plan on returning to this event nor recommending any friend go there.  \n\nBOTTOM LINE:  Check out the Gardens or the Conservatory, by day.  Hold off on the \"Cocktails in the Conservatory\" event until the kinks are worked out.","useful":2}

I've also enjoyed a fantastic omelette at Sunday brunch - (yes - they will do egg whites) and fresh fish for dinner if I recall correctly too.  In addition, O&I offers a delicious flatbread selection (great for sharing) as well as a fantastic wine list.\n\nOlive & Ivy seems to always have some kind of crowd, so depending on the size of your group, you may want to call ahead.\n\nTammar P and I had no problem getting a table when we met for a late lunch today.  We both went with the Greek salad (she with chicken and me with shrimp) and devoured it.  We declined the focaccia and dessert, so it was the perfect healthy yet filling lunch. I was glad we were on the same page with that!\n\nEstelle was our server and she was fabulous... she informed us that we ordered correctly today because during the month of April, when you purchase a Mediterranean Salad, O&I will donate 50% of the purchase to Waste Not (which delivers more than 5,000 lbs of food daily to a diverse group of agencies that feed the hungry, including schools, daycare centers, after-school programs, senior care facilities, transition homes and rehabilitation centers).  Sure makes me feel better about spending $20 per person on lunch!\n\nI'm sure I'll continue to rely on Olive & Ivy for many a fabulous meal ahead!","useful":8}

I had already stopped in a few times since they opened for coffee on the way to work, so I already knew the staff is friendly and courteous. This was confirmed today when, on their first really busy Sunday, the kitchen was backed up and the wait for food was long (we waited over 30 minutes for ours to come out, and even then it came out in waves). \n\nBoth our server and the (owner? manager?) made a point to stop at our table and thank us for our patience as they experienced their first busy weekend. Hey, I don't mind waiting too much if it's obviously something the management is aware of and trying to fix. I'm sure it will be smoother next time. \n\nThe food was excellent and lives up to the standards expected from the folks at Tuck Shop. We went with the boxty, two donuts, sauteed potatoes, a pancake (1 is very large and fluffy), and an egg/cheese omelet. \n\nCritiques:\n1)The menu specifically states \"no substitutions\" for breakfasts. However, I was told when I ordered that if I didn't want a side of meat, they would deduct the charge for it. So apparently, they are not as inflexible as they seem, but I wish I had known that while I was frantically trying to compose a breakfast that didn't include meat. \n\n2)Because of the above-mentioned \"rule\", the logical solution is to order from the (small) a la carte section at the bottom, which is what my husband did. It would be nice if they would ask if you want everything to come out on the same plate rather than trying to fit a separate plate for 1 pancake, potatoes, 1 omelette, and donuts on the table when it was really all one meal. We ended up doing it ourselves at the table and handing 3 empty plates back to the server. \n\n3)Order the donuts. If you like things that are amazing, then don't miss these. OK, that wasn't a critique. I just couldn't wait to mention these little puffs of funnel-cake heaven.\n\n4)Hey! Vovomeena! There are a lot of vegetarians in the world, and we want to give you money to make our food. We're not asking you to change your world-view or anything, but just a little acknowledgement that not everyone wants a \"choice of meat\" on every single menu item. You guys are pretty light on the fruit and vegetable side of things, and no, fried potatoes don't count. And how about some other options besides cheese in the omelette? Please? \n\n5)If you are an inflexible vegan, there is absolutely nothing you can eat here. Except maybe the potatoes, but I bet they're sauteed in butter. You can, however, enjoy a tasty soy latte and pout while your friends enjoy their food. But then again, you're vegan; you're used to this. (sigh)\n\nI will eat here again. I promise to add a star next time if either the wait time or the non-meat options are improved...I will even think about adding TWO stars if both of those requests are heeded.","useful":8}

Yummy, yummy breaded cabo fish burrito with black beans, roasted red sauce, homemade sour cream, (instant) rice and mild guajillo sauce. My Pink Cadillac cocktail was also delicious, if overpriced. There was a decent wine list but most wines were only available by the bottle, not by the glass, which further pissed me off.\n\nPRICE: Highly overpriced for Mexican food. $16 for a fish burrito is too much. $9 for guacamole and chips is too much. I make guacamole on an almost daily basis and I know what one avocado mashed up in a bowl looks like. What we paid $9 for wasn't even one avocado's worth - it was mostly chips. $12 for a tequila cocktail pre-made from a mix by someone who's barely of legal drinking age is also too much. Website's menu prices are inaccurate. We also ordered a mojito pitcher ($49) that alleged to serve seven people, which would work out to $7 a glass (not bad) but were unable to squeeze even four full glasses out of it. So more like $12 per glass.\n\nSERVICE: Amateur hour. Not 24 hours prior a group of 20 of us ate at Gio Rana's, where they handled our table like champs and gave us absolutely no trouble. Chimichanga's wasn't even close to as busy and could hardly handle our table of 7. \n\nIn almost every review I read about the fresh guacamole made at the table with mortar and pestle. I was so looking forward to it, until our server told us that they only do that on the first floor. We were saddled on the second floor so we were SOL. And honestly, that was the general mood and attitude of the servers all night: \"Guess you're shit outta luck!\"\n\nI was excited about the fresh guacamole because I normally can't eat it due to an onion intolerance. When I ordered my burrito I was told that the guac in the burrito isn't fresh (when exactly is it made?) and that they couldn't accommodate my no onion request. When I asked if they could take a spoonful from the fresh batch and dump it onto my plate the server said no. The concept of a food sensitivity or allergy was apparently foreign to this boy because he told me I should just get it anyway since \"you can barely taste the onion.\"\n\nKAT: So I guess I'll just get the burrito without salsa and guacamole? \nSERVER: I guess.\nKAT: What kind of Mexican food is that, with no guac?\nSERVER: Dunno. \nKAT: So I guess I'll just do that then.

I busted out my iPhone calculator and tabulated my drinks and burrito plus 13.5% tax and went up to the bar to get some change so I could leave a tip. \n\nBut guess what the response was when I asked for change? \n\nSERVER: We don't do that.\nKAT: ??

We started on the patio and had drinks and some light apps including hummus and flatbread and their delicious bacon fat heirloom popcorn.  (They had vegetarian popcorn as well).  After about an hour, we moved inside to where there were three large rectangular tables set for our group with our own special menus.  We were able to choose from two mini-salads and four entrees and then we had family-style desserts.  I went with the infamous \"original Chopped salad\" to start and then chose the Pan Seared Scallops as my entree.  I think I cleaned both plates... and those around me likely had order envy as I definitely ordered right!  In addition, service was spectacular... somehow the Citizen staff managed to serve all 45 of us within minutes of each other!  They also kept our waters and our wine glasses full, which I'm sure added to the experience.\n\nI recently saw a preview of the new fall menu which includes some interesting items such as Chicken & Waffles, Applewood Smoked Duck Breast, and Grits + Gumbo...

I lived across the street at was then The Pointe, one of the best apartment complexes I lived at to this day, until they went condo. I have seen all kinds of changes with this bar over the years. I've seen it go from many identities from the small rocker dive bar I first knew it as.\n\nSo, no one had done a review about it in the decade I've known about it? Spidey sense tingling, I wonder what's going on. This seems like a place yelpers would have hit by now.\n\nThere are some interesting stories I remember from this place. Yelp is a great writing exercise for me. I write a review, but I also then expand things a second part with elaborated memories of drunken bad mistakes that sometime you'll eventually be able to read. I remember the kitchen and getting a lot of great food here. I ate in the dining room a lot, each Thursday studying the Mercury (now Citylife) and Las Vegas Weekly, when it had the Life in Hell comic inside and before it became known as a glossy cover nightclub strip directory. I poured over all the club fliers I got from Tower Records Wow on how to plan my party weekends. I was into raves, God was I ever that young? \n\nI worked in Henderson at a restaurant that's now closed, but on my nights off I wanted to go out and drink. I went to Scoundrels a lot before I branched out and discovered gems nearby like Royal Frog, what was (the first version of) Emergency Room, McMullan's, O'Ace's, and Chang's Hong Kong cuisine, all within walking. It's strange, I preach not to buy foreign, but yet I love Chinese food (hey, it's cooked here). And when I dress vintage I like to wear dragons, as long as it's made in the USA, to signify friendly WW2 relations with China during the early 40's.\n\nThere were a couple of reasons why I stopped going to Scoundrels, but by far it was discovering the other businesses around the area. But the first incident was a car theft that took place at the 7-eleven and Trop. Someone stole a car while the driver was inside \"for a minute,\" but the big deal was, there wound up being a kid in the back seat that the thief dropped off down the road in front of Skip's Gold Coin bar, called something else now. There's a crime tracker channel 8 web page. While the apartment complex I lived in had no crime (emergency calls were categorized as medical for retirees), I saw there was a lot more crime traffic on Decatur and Tropicana roads than I realized after I moved in.\n\nFor a bit, they started having a DJ house music night. by this time, my apartment complex was going condo and I had started another job on the strip in one of the busiest restaurants. I had to look for a new place to live which, if I could go back, would yell at myself to not move in with the people I chose. \n\nOn one of the nights I was considering going in, I decided not to for whatever reason. going thru storage boxes last winter, I remembered I was selling on ebay a lot during this time. I must have been putting up sales. But I remember on this particular night I decided not to go, the place was robbed when the thief determined the bar was empty with just the bartender. I have no idea how things could have gone if I was there. I was just holy sh**ting that I wasn't. \n\nSince, things have gotten better and the place is known for being patch friendly with a lot more bikers going there. A few would hang out the early times I was there, but I never wanted to ride my Honda up to where Harley's were parked. I hung out with a lot of biker's for the first time here and eventually went riding with a few to Stateline, the lake, Dam, out to Hacienda casino for cheap eats and beer. the important thing wasn't what I drove, but that I could keep up and to just enjoy the ride in the wind and sun. This was before texting made drivers an even greater danger than ones that disregard motorcycles and merge into your lane with no warning or of course signaling. \n\nGreat memories from Scoundrels!","useful":3}

Shout out to Mark P and a huge thank you for walking me through your second home!  I don't even know where to begin, but a few of my favorite areas were the sculpture garden (it's manicured perfectly), the fashion design collection (I learned about the real meaning of 'couture') and the contemporary art collection (specifically 'Mass' made of burnt wood, wire, and string as well as the mirrored, sound proof, LED lighted room (talk about getting lost in time).  There is so much more that I'll have to go back to see more of and the exhibits are constantly changing...\n\nPhoenix Art Museum also offers a ton of events and activities including films, workshops, demonstrations, and discussions.  There is also a really great area for the kids and teens as well as an Arcadia Farms on the premises.  Next year they will be celebrating their 50th anniversary, so I'm sure there will be plenty more unique festivities around that as well... don't wait to go though, go now!

This was a moment I was waiting for for a long time coming and there I was standing at the Plaza end, in front of the empty stage, listening to the echoing 80's easy listening music and seeing retirees and other groups of people waking around. People were hollering about march madness and the Mint 400, as drivers progressed and congregated along East Fremont all the way to the Atomic. \n\nFor whatever reason, Fremont Street has more polarized opinion than the Strip does, it seems. You love it or hate it, aside from the middle 3 star reviews here. I had goals to make new contacts or reacquaint with those I had known years ago. But my first few hours back on Fremont were pleasantly on my own to start re-exploring as Earth had intended me to do. You just get more spending mileage for your drinking & gambling dollars here. \n\nI'm a big fan of the Mayor Oscar's revitalization of Fremont Street, I may review East Fremont on it's own, regarding the shoe company playing Monopoly with businesses that have survived a lot longer than it's 3 retail store attempts pre recession. \n\nCasinos are getting refurbished by new owners, trying to mix new and keep enough of the Classic elements that made Las Vegas, mostly with nods in the form of black and white pictures of the olden days of casinos and celebrities from the 1880's to the 1960's. \n\nAround the Experience is the smell of fried foods, cement dust from construction, cigarette ash and the a.c. freon that's tough to describe, it does have a definite presence when you walk into any of the casinos. A lot of them are scented. I met the woman who did this, she worked for AromaSys and described the scents each casino, I have a list in one of my old work binders about it. I'll have plenty to yelp about til fall.\n\nI am biased about Fremont Street, it's always held great memories for me, even the bad ones worked out somehow. I realized what was different, it was how I went on to the next thing instead of get stuck in drama. There are a dozen casinos within walking in the space of a large casino on the strip. Casinos on the strip try to go for huge to get you lost inside when a lot of the times, you're looking for a way to get out of there just to experience something else. \n\nA couple of problems cropped up with the recession, namely street characters hustling tips for photos. A lot of characters don't make sense to be photographed with in Vegas, but it's reasonable to me that pee wee herman would be on his bike on one of his road trips. \n\nThe canopy show is bread and circuses when you consider the bad but improving areas around it. \"Don't go away from the lights\" is a traditional warning given. We used to go bar hopping all the way to Atomic and Bunkhouse past the Western and we were somehow considered stunt drinkers for doing this. It's planning, even on the Strip I kept my big bills pick pocket proof and never flashed a wad at a bar. \n\nBut, I love the light show at night. Yes, it's common denominator music, blame music marketing from the 80's and their top 40 radio stations. Look at the people looking up, the majority of people have smiles or are laughing, even those of us that have seen the show a hundred+ times. \n\nMaybe it was good that the Experience has a light show to represent it instead of a huge replica the USS Enterprise 1701, after corporate meddling affected the franchise.","useful":2}

Prices are good and I never had to worry about quality. The first time I came here, it was a football night and families were actually all over the place. They used to have a janky setup where you scraped your own plates in a bus tub, it was like a cafeteria, but the steaks and appetizers were/ are worth it. \n\nAnd then a few visits ago, they redid the whole dining room area. Instead of the awkward mini stage, there was a bank of televisions for sports, the table chair seating was replaced by nice dining tables and furniture. And gone were the bus tub setups! \n\nSo, I called it a Man's bar, but saw that families go there, too, which is nice. It separated The Lift from those janky afternoon hangout bars that are just filled with smoke and hardened old Robert Duval character types.\n\nThey serve sodas in cans, which is interesting to me. I actually like it because you know the soda 1) will be crisp and 2) not taste all syrupy or stale from the gummed up soda gun/ fountain that's been in use since the 70's. It always seems strange to me when a bartender gives you a can that they or sometimes you pop.

I reviewed the materials and determined that they were dreaming because the prices were too high for the product they intended to deliver.  Years later, The Signature opened up.  I never intended to stay here, but I followed the room rates and reviews closely as I have an interest in Las Vegas real estate and developments.\n\nSo, I am visiting Las Vegas and staying at The Skylofts at MGM.  I wanted to extend my stay, but the property was full for the extra nights.  My casino host offered to put us in a room at The Signature for the extra nights.  Reluctantly, I agreed.  Big mistake.  This property is so bad I would rather stay downtown.  Where to begin...\n\nI will start by saying something nice.  The lobby, the rooms, and the common areas were tastefully decorated.  Now, that we got that out of the way, time to blast this place for being the worst place I have ever stayed in Vegas.\n\nFor starters, I did not find the staff to be friendly at all from start to finish.  That would have been forgivable if they were efficient, but they weren't.  It all started with the dreadfully slow check-in process.  It wasn't crowded, it was just plain slow.  Slow to get to an agent, slow to get the keys and get away from the agent.  S-L-O-W.\n\nOnce we dropped out bags in the room, we realized just how far we were away from civilization.  Getting from the room to the casino or the taxi stand at MGM was a 15-minute walk.  Sure, you could take a taxi from The Signature, but that would require a concierge or bell hop actually providing you with a service.  You can't count on that!\n\nWe arranged a dinner reservation at Nobu and a limousine to take our group from The Signature to the Hard Rock Hotel through the concierge.  The driver showed up and took us to the restaurant, but the restaurant had no record of our reservation.  This was for a graduation celebration, and I set everything up, so I looked bad.  I called The Signature to get some assistance and they said the woman who helped me was gone for the day.  They were unable to get us into the restaurant, so it was a total loss.  We waited for over an hour before we were seated and although the food was good, it was hard to enjoy it since the staff acted as though they were doing me a favor by even allowing us to dine without reservations.\n\nWhen we got back to the hotel and spoke to the front desk, they didn't seem to care.  They admitted fault, but weren't really sorry.  Ok, things happen, but I thought they might offer a concession of some sort.  Nothing was offered so I didn't ask for anything.\n\nThen, it got worse.  One of my dinner guests who lives in Las Vegas had parked his car with the valet at The Signature.  After dinner, drinks and a bit of gambling, he got a phone call and needed to get home.  After the long walk back from the casino to The Signature, he was in a bit of a hurry to get out the door.  When he gave his parking ticket to the valet, the valet said he would grab his car immediately.  My guest gave the valet a $20 tip and asked him to please hurry.  That was the last time we saw the valet.  He left.  Not only did he leave, but he left with my guest's car keys.  We could see my guest's car, but we couldn't gain access to it.  My guest was officially stuck and the other people working there acted as though we were inconveniencing them by asking for help.  After about an hour, they somehow retrieved the keys from the missing valet and returned them to my guest.  He went home...upset. \n\nThis list of problems can continue, but I think you get the idea.  The staff in this hotel is incompetent, based on my experience.  Further, the management doesn't seem to care that the staff is causing problems for the guests.  I never voiced my complaints in a letter or anything, I just left and forgot about it...until now.\n\nIf you are considering The Signature, consider something else.  There are a ton of great properties on The Strip that are comparably priced and provide a better location, better service, and a better overall experience.  I visit Las Vegas 10 times a year, and have stayed virtually everywhere.  This is the only place I have vowed to NEVER return.","useful":6}

I know, in Vegas, we're used to having a ton of well lit, cleans stalls to choose from in casinos and cleaning crews that check more than once a quarter. Outside of Vegas, I realized I became something of a public bathroom snob with the 1 stall selection, let alone finding one. \n\nMost importantly, the library is where I go to find answers. I get so sick of follow your dreams and passions and other no meaning affirmations, it says nothing about actual steps to increase (have) income or how to deal with all the a-holes that butt in, or threaten to tell- wah wah- pot and kettle crap, when we're finally having a good time. Books in the library DO help.\n\nOne of my favorite tv shows was Buffy, just because a lot of finding the answers was done in the library, pounding the books. The library keeps me from watching idiot tv. It keeps me out of bars, since I don't have money or my drinking buddies anymore. It keeps me out of stores when I shouldn't look at things I don't need.\n\nAnd, it's one of the places I can be happy, when I can find a quiet place and a comfy chair to read.","useful":1}

The vet said the nail needed to be clipped off at the base and told me she would take him in the back to give him a reversible sedation and would cut the nail down. I was told it would be about $40 for the exam and $80 for the reversible sedation. I was given the choice to stay and wait or leave and come back. I stayed (in hindsight, we both should have left). \n\nThe problems began soon thereafter:\n\n--First, let me be clear that this nail was painful to the touch and Leo would pull away if you touched it. I was not happy to realize they did not plan to give him a local block (pain med - Lidocaine - at the site of the nail) during the procedure until I specifically requested on it. (Shall we pause for a moment and just imagine someone cutting your nail off at the base without any local anesthetic).\n\n--Second, during the procedure I heard him yelping from the back and was soon informed they hadn't actually done the reversible sedation as we'd discussed, they'd given him Acepromazine instead (a tranquilizer). I was informed he was yelping because the local anesthetic stings as it's administered and he wasn't responding to the tranquilizer enough to not be feeling it. I was told they'd done almost everything else they needed to besides the one nail. I inquired what needed to be done besides the ONE problem nail we'd come in for. Well, they'd trimmed the other 15.\n \n--Third, given that he wasn't responding to the tranquilizer well and they were struggling to give him the local block, I was told that I had two options at this point: one, they basically hold him down and cut the nail - it will be painful but fast. (SERIOUSLY?!) Or two, they give him a more serious sedative (Propofol) to knock him out, then cut the nail.  I opted for the sedative, not realizing until later that this was not my best choice. (Mind you, I couldn't have known this at the time because I was not fully advised of the risks or potential consequences.)   \n\nShortly thereafter I am reunited with poor cone-head Leo who is a droopy, lethargic mess. I am also promptly handed a bill for $260.\n\nRRRRRREWIND!! \n\nLet's check our math here:  $40 for exam + $80 for sedation = $120. Somehow things managed to more than double. I'm promptly advised that they did \"wound care\" and \"bandaging\" (neither of which were mentioned as necessary prior) which totaled about $80, plus there was the head cone & the Lidocaine I requested so there's another $40+.\n\nUmm. Stop right there.  $80 for WOUND CARE AND BANDAGING?!   \n\nSo, let's recap. I've now got a droopy, falling over dog, the whole procedure didn't go at all as we'd discussed originally, and I'm getting nickel and dimed (actually, more like Hamilton'd or Jackson'd) on my way out the door.  SUPER. \n\nOkay, so at least they agree to take the $80 for wound care/bandaging off and I high-tail it out of there.  You may have thought the adventure ends there, but NO... my droopy dog is so sedated on the way home he poops in the backseat. So now I've got a steaming pile of crap in the backseat and a steaming owner in the front seat, which really was a perfect ending to how I felt about this whole experience.\n\nI later reviewed what happened with three other vets I trust (all out-of-state friends/relatives) to get second opinions. In brief, all felt the tranquilizer seemed an inappropriate choice for this sort of procedure given Leo's breed and high energy level. All also had a lot of concerns about the use of Propofol (the sedative used) as they felt it was a riskier choice than using the reversible sedative we'd originally discussed using.\n\nIt's pretty safe to say this bridge is burned. Whole Pet will probably be glad to know that I, Marissa B (the pet owner who clearly has unrealistic expectations that someone will actually do the procedure as discussed, will fully inform me of risks/consequences, and advise me of actual costs upfront) will no longer be returning.","useful":43}

Plus they have refurbished all the locations to make them more of a department store environment.\n\nI wouldn't normally go to this location, because it's across town from where I live (west Sahara) but someone I know works nearby, so I occasionally am in the area.\n\nI like savers because I have to clean out my own boxes of things. And when you bring in your stuff, they give you a 20% coupon. \n\nIn a Savers, all the items are tagged with a certain color, I think one of 8 maybe. I think this is to keep the stock rotating, because they feature a color for 99 cents every week. The trick is to know what day that is and get in on that first day when the selection is of course the most. One thing that pisses me off about this is that local vintage buyers from other stores stockpile a cart overfilling them with clothes that they'll sell at a markup of at least a factor of 8, over retail in their trendy vintage/ retro, no refund stores. I'm normally a fan of small businesses, but this is predatory on consumers and other businesses. \n\nIt annoys me already when a woman is taking all the good medium shirts from the men's section. This is a sexist statement, but how would you feel if a guy was taking all the good woman's dresses and blouses and things that you might be interested in? Especially if that guy was a buyer for their store? I know there may be mothers, but if the son isn't there, you KNOW he's not going to like what she's picked for him. And if I like it, the shirt goes to waste and the kid will eventually send it back to Savers later in tattered condition. \n\nI digress. Savers is doing something department stores have done. They'll move a couple of sections around every month. and I discovered this is because people tend to get jaded and go to \"their isles\" in a particular store they've been in before. And this mixes the store up so people may go into areas they might not normally and get caught up looking around there. I always wondered why they did that at hell-mart. I thought it was managers squeezing more labor out of their workers, keep everyone busy for no real reason.","useful":0}

Kim did a decent job, and I would return in a bind for sure... but I do feel bad cheating on Rose, my regular pedicure gal (see Allure Nails review).  \n\nOne thing I did like about Pretty Nails is that you can pay for add-ons to the basic pedicure a la carte.  In addition to the basic pedi ($20), I went with a sugar scrub ($5) and 10 extra minutes of foot massage ($10).  They include a 5 minute massage, so I had a total of 15 minutes.  This made my total before tip $35.  It was a treat, and my feet look a hell of a lot better now in \"Lincoln Park After Dark\" than they did in whatever chipped color I had on before.  So, if you find yourself in the area and in need of a mani or pedi, this place is A-OK.  \n\nBottom line - I feel better now that I confessed that I cheated on Rose.

I'm not sure what that means, exactly, since when is bok choi DEhydrated anyway? I don't think she thought I'd like it because it was more of a traditional Chinese soup, but I loved it. It was very brothy with ultra-boiled greens, some unfamiliar mushroom or possibly dried plum thing, and (I think) boiled peanuts. The broth had a slightly sweet quality to it, similar to Pho broth. I'm not making the soup sound that good, but it was. Just try it. \n\nI had heard that the winter melon soup is great, but the woman told me that while occasionally they have it as a daily soup, usually you have to call a couple of days in advance to order it so they can prepare.\n\nI'm so glad I finally found a good neighborhood Chinese restaurant.","useful":4}

I also added on a \"floater,\" a 10-minute scalp massage ($10), which was awesome.  Half way through my session, Larysa wasn't feeling well, so someone else took over, but I know that was likely a fluke.  I enjoyed watching \"Julie and Julia\" during my time there... I guess they show girly movies all of the time which is a nice touch.  They also offer plenty of magazines and snacks.

On the other hand it sure says something about women in particular not feeling safe/comfortable in (for lack of a better word) \"straight\" dance clubs.  Non-gay men, take note - your club behavior drives women away from non-gay dance clubs to places where they can safely have fun without someone coming up and grinding on them from behind without permission.  No.  That's not okay. \n\nBut I digress.  Plan B was fine, I would go back if I had people in town who wanted to dance.  I probably wouldn't head here on a regular basis simply because I didn't love the music.  I enjoy Top 40 but I don't need a techno-beat attached to everything.  Sometimes sing-a-longs are fun just as they were written.  Well-drinks were cheap ($3) and strong; Someone missed the memo that if you're going to upcharge for \"on the rocks\" you  need to actually also put more liquor in that cup too  (Jack = $7.50 and not particularly generous).  Sigh.  \n\nThe dance floor was large so there was plenty of space on this Saturday night to not knock elbows with everyone else.  Cover was $5 and there was no line at 10pm when we arrived.  Perhaps the cover charge could go towards some minor bathroom repairs - they were in rough shape with stall doors that don't lock and toilet paper rolls precariously stuck wherever they'd fit, as there were no holders.       \n\nBOTTOM LINE: I liked the crowd and the dance floor was decent sized.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go back but wouldn't object if out-of-towners wanted to hit the dance floor.","useful":4}

If she can apply this polish with extreme precision without flinching, I know I've found my nail nirvana.\n\nSuch was the case today when I was traipsing my way through The Junction and happened upon Pearl Nails for a walk-in manicure. At $8 the price truly could not be beat - but what kind of quality could such a ridiculously low pricetag possibly yield? It turns out, a very good one.\n\nWhile my manicurist prepared my personal nail kit, she asked me to write my name and phone number on the individual tackle box and to pick out my nail polish. I was impressed by the extreme colour organization on the OPI wall - everything was painstaking sorted by shade and hue so it was a cinch to dive right into the darks and pick out my beloved Lincoln Park After Dark. They also carry China Glaze, which I haven't seen at any other nail salons in Toronto yet.\n\nThe cuticle pushing, nipping and nail shaping was extremely thorough. The hand massage was equally drawn out and relaxing, enough for me to nearly fall asleep (bear in mind that I'm a bit of a narcoleptic). After she meticulously applied two coats of the polish and a top coat, she employed a really unusual and never-before-seen technique to touch up the imperfections: a small artist's brush dipped in nail polish remover. Usually manicurists use an orange stick but this was much more dainty. She caught all of the errant nail polish and sent me off to the high tech dryer station - which was an actual dryer, not a ghetto fan aimed at the general hand area). \n\nLike most Toronto nail salons, this was a silent operation - limited English in this salon, which was fine with me as I concentrated on listening to the new Spoon EP on my iPod instead. Oh, and they also accept debit, which hardly any of these small Asian salons ever do...\n\n$8! For a perfect manicure! Unheard of. I really hope it lasts - I'll report back in a week!\n\nAMUSING ANECDOTE: A woman stormed in asking for an \"emergency bikini wax\" and they told her they could do it but she'd have to wait 10 minutes, to which she replied that it had to be right now, because \"my husband is in the LCBO and I only have about 8 minutes to spare.\" They actually accommodated her request and she was in and out within 8 minutes!!","useful":12}

We were greeted immediately by Duke, one of the owners.

Jared went with a variety of tart flavors including Green Tea, Pomegranate, and Original.  We both chose from their variety of toppings including all kinds of fresh fruit, cereal, marshmallows, chocolate, mochi, and boba.  Yes, I said boba!  \n\nIt was $6.42 total for both of our concoctions... 39 cents per ounce.  (Yikes - I just did the math and that means that we shared a total of 16.46 ounces - that's a lot!) Susie, Duke's cousin, rang us up.  \n\nDuke informed us that they always have at least one dairy free flavor and I noticed that most of the flavors were gluten free as well... they also offer a shaved ice machine, which Duke recommends putting in your cup and mixing with the frozen yogurt.

I learned how to chop onions and find good places to eat and act smug when we got sent special food out.  About three years into our relationship she helped open up Much Gusto.  She was a \"creative consultant\" for the menu and our roommate was the restaurant manager.  We also knew the chef she was working with and I often recall this chef as I dine there, who once told me a story with his thick Mexican accent about doing shrooms in Mexico and then burning all of his pants.  She only helped open the place, working ridiculous hours for about a month, and then when the kitchen and menu were in order she moved on. \n\nEven after she moved on from the opening, Mucho was a go-to place for a while.  Out roommate ran the place so one holiday when the restaurant was closed we got to go in there and cook our holiday meal in their kitchen, partake in the bar goods and act like big shots having the place to ourselves.  I have a million memories of staying after hours around the fire, on the patio, drinking vodka tonics and talking about food and music and people.  These are fond memories, so perhaps my review of the place as a current dining experience might be biased.  But I don't care, I'll always love Mucho. \n\nThis was many years ago, I believe the owner is the same but the menu has changed, the chef has changed and we've been broken up for many years; she slings food at FnB and I date boys now instead of girls.  What's odd though is that despite it being a spot which was a staple in my past life with her it has upheld the test of time and become one of the boyfriend and I's favorite places for good food and tasty margaritas. \n\nThe best thing you can order at Mucho are the flautas.  These are absolutely perfect; juicy and spicy and perfect with this tangy, thick sauce that kills me every time.  We also never fail to order the Quaso, as melted cheese with tortillas are just perfect in making you feel fat but also releasing two millions endorphins.  Most times we visit Mucho we split an order of the Quaso and an order of flautas and it's the perfect amount of food.  The margaritas are always well prepared and it's worth it to have like four if you go for happy hour.  The salsa is actually spicy and the bus boys are way better at refilling your empty chip bowl than the servers.  \n\nAnother thing I love about Mucho is that they play good music.  It may seem menial, but the stupid mainstream bullshit music that makes its way into most upscale-yet-not-fine-dining places is repetitive, crappy and mostly annoying.  I've heard Mucho play some bands I wouldn't normally expect to hear in such a place, and am always surprised and pleased by it.  As in, \"holy shit they're playing old school Modest Mouse.  Weird.\"\n\nThe only complaint I have about Mucho is, of course, the service.  It's true what the other reviewers say, the service is slow, all the hot chicks that work there seem a little dumb, and you always have to wait forever for more drinks and sometimes they just plain forget.  Usually when we go to Mucho we're planning on hanging out for a while so it's not such a huge deal to wait, but I can understand how it gets annoying.  \n\nThey need to stop hiring hot chicks and hire some smart people instead. \n\nRecently, I went to Mucho for my 25th birthday, probably about five years after my first visit to the opening, and ate on the patio with a couple of close friends and partook in a cozy and memorable dining experience.  But like I said before, I'm biased.","useful":2}

I wrote this review before I tried to change my return flight and learned that it would cost more ($748) than my entire round-trip ticket ($610) to do so. I'm almost tempted to take away that second star...\n\nI checked in the night before without any trouble. I had already hand-selected my seat (using http://www.seatguru.com) over a month ago when I booked the flight and kept my preference when I checked in online. Because of the new travel restrictions, I had to check my suitcase. For some reason Air Canada does not allow you to print your own luggage tag for U.S.-bound flights the way all other airlines do. So instead of proceeding directly to customs and security, I had to wait in line with the rest of the plebes who were checking in manually. There was no separate line for \"baggage dropoff\" (I use quotes because the word dropoff implies speed and convenience, neither of which I experienced). It was the equivalent of depositing a cheque at the ATM and then having to go wait in line at the teller to withdraw the same money. Not impressed.\n\nNo fewer than 200 people ahead of me in line - with over two hours to spare before my flight's departure you'd think it'd be plenty of time, but no. There was a lot of panic in this lineup. A few people crying, some others yelling, and many utterances of \"this is mind-boggling.\" There were many angry passengers being consoled by AC personnel for either missing their flights or being told they'd have to leave their baggage behind. Also, you have to pay for additional checked bags in excess of one, and the pay pad was broken, causing further delays. At this point I had been waiting an hour. \n\nAn AC attendant did a callout for passengers on flights departing within an hour because there was a risk we wouldn't make our flights at this point. Excitement ensued! A few of us stepped forward and went to the front of the line. I put my bag on the scale and told the check-in attendant  that I just had to drop the bag of - I had already checked in. She furrowed her brow and walked away without saying anything. Came back ten minutes later and did a bit more typing, and asked one of her colleagues some questions. I heard mumblings of \"was that person authorized to do that? I can't find her passenger info.\" I stood there out of the loop.\n\nME: Is there a problem? I checked in last night and just printed my boarding pass. I'm literally just dropping off this bag. \nAIR CANADA ATTENDANT: It appears you're not on the flight. Someone has undone your check-in. \nME: Uhhh...OK. Well, check me back in I guess? I dunno. I need to get through security and customs.  \nAIR CANADA ATTENDANT: You've lost your seat, so you can no longer sit at the window. I'm putting you in the centre seat, row 38 (ie: by the shitter).\nME: But I chose my seat for a reason, and I did it a month ago.\nAIR CANADA ATTENDANT: Someone else is in that seat now. \nME: .....\nAIR CANADA ATTENDANT: OK, I'll put you in the exit row at the window. \n\nI scored a sweet seat with tons of leg room (not that I really needed it). There was no seat in front of me, and the guy in the next row (who I imagine had requested an extra leg room seat and was hoping I wouldn't make it onto the flight so he could take it) glared at me for the first 30 minutes of the flight. \n\nThe flight was on time and the staff was pleasant, although I'd make the following recommendations:\n- the francophone flight attendant reading the emergency procedures script had a limited grasp of the English language. For flights heading to the U.S., should FAs not be fluent in English?\n- please throw me a free sandwich or other meal. Tack on an extra $30 to my flight, I don't care. After paying $600 for a six hour flight I should not have to pull out my wallet to pay for food just because I'm not crossing an ocean.","useful":5}

Given that they know what's going to be sold out waaayyy ahead of time, you'd think they'd accommodate the demand by adding an extra screening or two to add more shows of whatever film is super popular that day. I'm either way ahead of my time with my fancy ideas for accommodating demand with extra screenings or way behind my time by not just buying my stooopid tickets ahead of time on-line.

As far as I know Tula is one of only two studios in Toronto that specializes in hot - aka Bikram - yoga (Active Yoga being the other) and it definitely has the leading edge. They have regular classes in addition to hot ones so if you're an absolute beginner I would recommend one of those to get primed on the poses beforehand. Bikram can be a bit intense if you don't know what to expect. And even if you do, it can be challenging, especially in the summer when you're already feeling steamy.  \n\nWhen I worked in the area I was hooked on Tula's Tuesday night community class, which was $10 and taught by this supercutie \"Emma\". Each class was pretty similar from week to week so I really got to know Emma's style and the order of the poses. She introduced me to the \"pyramid pose\" and \"pigeon pose\", which are both a killer runner's stretch that you will hate while you're doing them, but love later when you start enjoying better flexibility and fewer injuries. Then Emma suddenly went away and some other random teachers took over, so I switched to another, regular class with \"Daniel\", whose class was way advanced and intense. Like, all the men in the class would take off their shirts to expose fiercely hot bodies and most of the participants were longtime yoginis. I believe it was a hot ashtanga class whereas Emma's was a beginner hatha class. Daniel also did a lot of breath work and meditation at the end of the class.\n\nYes, you will sweat like a beast and a shower afterwards is an absolute must, but you will feel sooo good and limber.","useful":3}

Cleveland has had historically LOW attendance this year.  Turns out this was the ONLY game that sold out so far this year.  C'mon.  The stadium was packed.  The concourse was a giant sweat factory of horror because it was raining, humid, everyone was slightly wet and sticky, and EVERY PERSON IN THE PLACE WAS STANDING ON THE CONCOURSE.  The concourse is not built for this kind of crowd so, as you can imagine, it was horrible to try and walk anywhere.  \n\nApparently the Indians offer some kind of Bud Light special where 12oz cans are $2.  That is AMAZING considering this is a ballpark and beer is usually like $109 a glass.  Of course, the lines to get this cheap ass beer were super long.  We started waiting in one.  Limit two per purchase but that was fine.  We wait for 25 minutes.  We can see the light... we're nearing the table to order.  When there were six people between us and the cheap beer some park worker comes up and announces that all the beer is now $4 a can.  Now, I know you're gonna say \"Well, Jenna, $4 is still cheap so why are you complaining?\"  BECAUSE IT'S THE PRINCIPLE.  Why did we wait all that time for some dude to arbitrarily announce that the price changed?  There was no signage that indicated a stop time for this promotion so why would the price change suddenly while people were in line?  We went to Fan Services to see if we could get answers and the two people working there were incredibly rude.  I received better customer service when I emailed the Indians via their website so I feel a little better... though still no one has answered my questions about why the promotion randomly ended or what happened.\n\nThere were still $4 cans of beer at certain places in the park so you could always get something kind of cheap.  Decent.  I know it's not the Indians' fault that it rained but their ballpark gets pretty shitty once it does and everyone is drinking and the game isn't starting.  My husband and I never saw an actual game here; instead, we spent two-and-a-half hours sitting around drinking beer slowly and avoiding food because it didn't seem worth it to eat and drink here just for them to call the game off... we saw a lot of the stadium but it was too crowded to enjoy or go into a shop so we just had to leave.","useful":2}

Excellente and spicy. Then I had a bowl of Crema de Cilantro, which was rich and creamy and almost smoky...would love to recreate at home. Entrees: I had a combo of mole and ropa vieja.

If you look at it from the glass is half full perspective, it has been around for a long time, it has served as the backdrop for many Vegas memories, and it is a really notable landmark on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nHowever, I cannot forget the smell when you walk inside, the glass windows at the entrance that seemingly never get cleaned of the fingerprints that cover them literally from top to bottom, and the overall 'quality' of the place.  It was built by the Circus Circus company in the 80's and opened in 1990, and I truly believe they are still running on the original format.  All the way down to the rooms.  Yes, I once visited a room at the Excalibur for a short period of time...don't ask.  I heard they renovated 2,000 rooms with updated TV's and furniture in 2007.  That would'nt be enough.\n\nIf you enjoy bad service, dining at the Excalibur might be perfect for you.  They have a Dick's Last Resort on the property.  Ever been to one?  It is hilarious, if you understand that the staff is paid to be rude to you.  \"Shut up and eat your damn food!\"  That would be an appropriate response from your server if you asked for napkin.  Good stuff like that.  I grew up in Dallas with one at the West End.  We used to go down there as high schoolers, get drunk, and argue with the staff.  Oh, the memories.\n\nThey also have a medieval dinner show (Tournament of Kings) where actors and actresses fight with swords, joust, and prance around on horses.  Can you say appetizing?  Meanwhile, you get to eat with your hands after you pluck the chicken and slaughter the cow.  That is actually false, apart from the eating with your hands part.\n\nI don't know what other restaurant options they have, but I am sure a 24-hour cafe/diner is in the mix, at the very least.  If they have a 'fine dining establishment' I would recommend eating elsewhere.  They have some shows.  Louie Anderson, Defending the Caveman and The Thunder from Down Under is what the website is currently showing.\n\nAs for the casino, I have had a lot of fun here.  The dealers are friendly, the tables are cheap compared to other nearby properties, and the people who play here are usually in good spirits.  The casino is the best part of the Excalibur, hands down.  Besides, you get used to the smell after a few minutes and then you can start focusing on the crowd.  As Elizabeth L. said, lots of fanny-packs, jorts, and sleeveless shirts.  Yee-haw!\n\nOne thing to note is that the thing that makes this Las Vegas Strip property unique is the actual exterior itself.  Just seeing it at night is what it is all about, and you don't have to be that close to do this.  As a matter of fact, the further away you are, the more impressive it looks.  Once you get up close, the facade looks pretty cheap and dated.\n\nOther than that, the Excalibur doesn't have a shark aquarium, an indoor waterfall, impressive gardens, a volcano, world-class shopping or anything else noteworthy (at least not for the right reasons).  Instead, they have a dingy looking moat, which has been empty for the bulk of the past 10 years, a weird looking dragon thing that I have not seen working in the past 10 years, a kiosk selling items with flashing LED lights on them, and a tram that takes you to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay.

It's about bar hangout nights, mistakes made by us and our circle of friends, people and their legendary accomplishment in local folklore, and all those girls (guys for some of you) we met before the \"one.\" Those Vegas lone wolf days for me went to 2007-ish. BJ's was a hidden gem I found and protected for a long time.\n\nI think of women on a hot/ cool scale myself. I met women of either, so my favorites were at the center of my social bell curve. The bartender/ servers here were always friendly. It was a big shock. I had been to all the Hooters and never received the service I had heard so much about and even saw at neighboring tables. \n\nBut at BJ's the women talked, hung out and even knew me after a time. I admit, I went during slower times and understood I wasn't the only one there when it was busy. The first one to make me feel welcome was Starr.\n\nStarr is... huge, and I mean that in the coolest, amazonian way. Definite American Gladiator worthy. I met most of the others, also and was happy when they not only asked me about work, but about specific problems left in the air from before. One of the servers, who I'll call Leigh here, was impressed that I didn't try to bed the girls like the other guys. \n\nI gotta say, I like the steak special. I've had most things off the menu. A few times I went early in the night, I'd get a quick lobster dip and pita bread. There's nothing like that in my neighborhood so I dream about great bar food. \n\nAs we got to know each other, it eventually led to a date with the second bartender I had been out with in Vegas. In my mind, this was an unattainable thing like dating a cheerleader in high school, which I never did. Did that give me confidence in that area? Who knows. I never expect when someone at either far end of the bell hints to go out. But I sure as hell ask when signs are go. \n\nWe had been out many times, I had followed her to several bartending jobs after she left. It was sad to see her understandably move away with the recession. But, she visited me when she vacationed, which to me was a very big deal in a city of people flaking with all the things that \"come up\" (read= texted a better party). \n\nI did take visiting friends here once.

I highly recommend her - she explained every product she was using as I fell in and out of a relaxing sleep while she not only worked on my face but my shoulders, chest, neck, scalp, hands and feet... the products felt amazing and smelled good too.

The Parlor presents a strong offering with it's pizza crust and amiable service, however, it's actual pizza topping combinations and entrees are poorly balanced in terms of taste.\n\nThe only dish I like there is their build-your-own pizza, where I usually get the feta, goat cheese, bacon, artichoke hearts, arugula (light, otherwise they pile enough on to make it fit for a rabbit) and speck. The crust started out nice, but as time went on it got limp so I had to specify that they take time with it (surprising since that's their core value). Otherwise, it's sturdy, just crispy just soft enough, and holds the imperfections that characterize a good pizza crust well.\n\nI tried their pre-selected topping pizzas twice, and both times felt they were bland and/or too savory. Their seafood pasta was nearly inedible, with some of the seafood being overcooked and rubbery. Desserts were quite inedible (chocolate cake (with fennel...) was dry and tasted like it was out of a box).\n\nService during lunch was good, though during dinner the same cannot be said. I was also severely disappointed when they were unwilling to make simple accomodations for repeat customers, which re-affirms my conclusion that this is a nice lunch place, but lacks the experience in food quality and service to make for a good dinner.\n\nP.S. Ordered takeout for work once and had a co-worker get a sandwich; he was a little disgusted that the sandwich had large chunks of cauliflower on it.

But I had to check in again. The buffet that was Pharaoh's Feast was one of my first jobs in Vegas! Circus Circus Enterprises days.\n\nI had to walk into one of the small rooms sometimes reserved for \"banquets\" since it was there in my first week of work, I had to give a girl the Heimlich maneuver. It was a big deal, that night I realized I changed the flow of history in the town I just moved to and I was also a hero for the night (until I got the corporate cya \"call 911 next time\" lecture of course). \n\nWith all the repainted crap upstairs, it was great to go to an area of the casino where there's still theming, the buffet still looks like an archaeological ruins dig. You know, historically the luckiest part of a pyramid is deepest below the center. I'm sure there's a woman who may have kids of her own (\"let me pick the chicken off the bones!\") that knows that. \n\nToo many memories of those days. As I walked around the casino, all I saw was what things used to be, those nights hanging out in Cleopatra's after work (not the barge up strip). I know backwards and forwards that \"changes\" are designed to bring in more money. But they're already doing that with new tenants a \"star bump\" above what was there. \n\nEmployees used to have to park across the street behind the gas station where I met Dan Aykroyd & Donna as they rode into town on their motorcycle caravan for the opening of Mandalay Bay. Gassing our motorcycles together is probably the coolest thing to happen, until I eventually worked at House Of Blues... To get to work we walked past the sphynx which people remind, is facing the wrong (spiritual) direction.\n\nWhile I imagined the past, I was adamantly reminding myself I came for the future. What is there to do now? What (conceivably) keeps people coming back here, especially the locals? The few times I went to LAX, people still talked about Ra.\n\nOn the attractions level, I missed the King Tut museum, and even the Obelisk 3 part experience, \"Don't you harm her!\" But I admit Titanic and Bodies are good replacements. How the hell they got that chunk of the ship up thru the casino to the attractions level should be a video on display itself. \n\nI still have a lot of Luxor stuff from my first casino employee sale haul when everything was papyrus and hieroglyphic themed. \n\nA big thrill when I knew someone coming to town that wasn't staying there was to take them up the inclinator to one of my favorite thinking spots. Show them the Chrysler building- yes, before the NYNY casino was built. There was a trick to get up there and I was sad that I didn't get the modern counterpart to do it last time. \n\nI used to go out to the pool area when that brunette sexpot from Body Shapers did their exercise show out there. I ran into Scott a few times in passing and he even recognized me when I saw him at a Cinevegas party. Guess his stage name.\n\nWhile memories spike a 5, all I can give the watered down experience now a 3. Instead of painting crap corporate blue, you could find, restore and bring back the camel Sigma Derby machines. That alone would roll an easy 4. People also still complain about removing the Nile ride. You don't even have to bring it back! Mock up a boat and backdrop and let us take pics of that! That retail space by the walkways could be leased by a couple of big trends, too. (hint: downtown. No, not shoes.)\n\nIn one of the lounges I sat, had a beer and ruminated. Sometimes Vegas, believe it or not, is not EPIC. Sometimes, you just relax in a quiet lounge and think while you look around mentally playing \"She's A Hooker.\" Nope, that one's just a big deal back home.

I had a completely different experience than the positive reviews written previously.\n\nThe staff was not friendly, nor did they seem knowledgeable about their menu.  Our waitress seemed to be in her own world, and the support she had with keeping water glasses filled, checking on us, etc... was pretty non-existent. Still, we were in good company and had higher hopes for the food.  We ordered a bottle of wine for the table (half off on Tuesdays, which was a great incentive to go the bottle route) and a variety of items ranging from garlic edamame, seaweed and Thai Beef salad to some standard maki, sashimi, and a couple of their signature rolls as well.  \n\nWhen our wine arrived, our waitress placed it on our table without pouring any of us glasses.  Weird, right?  The food was edible, but none of it tasted particularly fresh.  The cuts of fish were difficult to chew... the spice and dressings were off as well.  The items came out at different times and were basically thrown on the table at us without much explanation.  Upon waiting for my final roll to arrive (the BLVD), a roll that resembled nothing like the description was placed in front of me and the guy that delivered it said \"last up... the Blvd.\"  When I flagged someone else down to confirm, they confirmed my hunch - it was definitely not the Blvd roll.  The correct roll came shortly after.\n\nWe made the most of our experience and had fun due to the company, but none of us will be back again... I had high hopes but was disappointed by Squid Ink.  If you find yourself here, perhaps try the cooked food; I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that it has to be better than the sushi.","useful":19}

They should have gone the \"greasy spoon\" route and taken the ironic pride in that the way hooters and heart attack grill- MAN, I have to write up that place soon. \n\nI was used to winding up there at the end of the night (early morning), trying to sober up for the long, long, 20 minute drive home. Considering you pass by a dozen cops in that 20, yeah it's a big deal. \n\nAnd years ago, I used to drive a motorcycle. And those aren't really a target for police, since people seem to get away with 80mph wheelies on the 215, you know you've seen it. I would have to sober up, you have to have a lot more skill driving a motorcycle home than holding a 6 position and dropping your foot on the gas. Cars don't even have stick anymore!\n\nThe last time I ate there was a big surprise for me in itself. I strolled in late morning, of my own accord! Not on the way home after a night of bar skirmishes! Hours AFTER the sunrise. It was to start a day of walking around downtown! \n\nLet me say, when you are drunk and starved, everything is the BEST meal you've ever tasted. You are basically crawling in from the desert at those Golden times. So the big surprise was, at my morning sober, the food was great and the employees were as friendly as I remember them being on grave, not all hagged out and bitter about life the way some non-morning people on the breakie shift can be.\n\nI'm going to be gender specific, so let's be adult about this. I have worked with men and women in restaurants and both sides unanimously agree that when the floor are all guys/ men, the whole crew is more easy going. I have gone into a restaurant to check out the employees, saw the server floor full of women (that weren't a breastaurant). I would listen to the gossip and cattiness and the maternal \"this is the way it's going to be speak\" not only to cowokers, but also other employees, including management if \"I've been here 8 years before you.\" In fact there's only one restaurant where the staff are women I felt really relaxed in. For another review, clue: bh fl. So the staff were mostly guys, the grill always had a kick back feel to it. \n\nI have dined in the chairs, but nothing beats bar counter service. I always find myself in the middle of someone's conversation. Everyone has gambling strategies (so why are they doing there with you at 3:00AM days before xmas instead of their villa?) People always has a big news story they butcher any facts of when you see a newspaper or story on tv later. If there's an argument it's always funny between a couple of old guys. Couples and families always sit at tables. Old guy debates are just fun for some reason, you get into it.\n\nSadly, my last meal there wasn't the prime rib special. I've had it several times. I used to work in a restaurant that served prime rib and I wondered what the big deal was of a request of people. It was in the golden grill I finally appreciated how good the end cut really was. There's a secret to the end cut when you can get it and for that gem, you'll have to pour a pitcher down my throat.\n\nGreat times at the grill, they didn't have advertising that manufactured it's ambiance. Bitch, please they just HAD it.","useful":1}

I'm a fan of MRIs!\" \n\nBut seriously - my doctor requested an MRI for me in June 2008 and last fall I finally got the letter in the mail telling me I had an appointment - I felt like a high school grad waiting for her university acceptance letter. I was THAT giddy. The appointment was for April 2009 at 4am. Such is the state of Canadian healthcare, ya know?\n\nThe Ontario MRI Centre at Mount Sinai is one of only two places (that I know of) where you can get an MRI in Toronto. The centre operates 24/7 and each MRI takes about 30-50 minutes, meaning they're doing 25-50 every single day. Mind-boggling.\n\nIf you're arriving after 10pm you have to use the Murray Street (side) entrance and sign in. When you arrive make sure you have both a valid Ontario health card as well as the Mount Sinai hospital card. If you don't have the latter, you'll have to go get one from admitting.\n\nI signed in, filled out a questionnaire with the standard \"are you pregnant? have you ever worked as a welder? do you have metal in your eyes?\" questions and took a seat. \n\nAt 4am I was called and asked to change into a hospital gown. Here's a breakdown of the MRI prep:\n- remove all clothing except undercrackers and socks, put on gowns\n- remove ALL jewelry (I had to take out my piercings, which was a bitch to do, but had to be done), hairpins & clips, watches, etc. The entire room where you get the MRI has a magnetic field and you do NOT want to be wearing anything metal once you step into the room.\n- put belongings in a locker and take the key, sit in secondary waiting area and wait to be called.\n\nAfter I went through that first part, I waited about five minutes in the absolutely silent room and was then greeted by a smoking hot MRI technician (cute/young guys always work the night shift, it seems) who handed me earplugs and a squeeze pump told me to lie down on the bed (sure, I'll lie down on the bed...). \n\nThen he told me it would take about 20-30 minutes to scan my head and that I had to remain perfectly still throughout. He also warned me that it would be really loud inside and that if I felt claustrophobic at any moment I could squeeze the pump he had given me. Then he fitted my head into this vice-like contraption - essentially he was putting padded blocks on either side of my head so that I wouldn't be able to turn it from side to side. It wasn't uncomfortable, just felt cozy and compact.\n\nHe slid me into the chamber (which admittedly is VERY tiny and claustrophobic) and things got started right away. I kept my eyes closed so that it would be easier to stay still, but there was a breeze and my hair kept tickling my face so it was hard. Once the MRI starts the noise is really, really loud and abrupt. \n\nIt's kind of like jackhammering directly in your ears, but the sound switches back and forth depending what they're doing. So sometimes it's a rhythmic clicking sound, sometimes it's drilling, other times it's beeps and glitchy noises. Very bizarre. Thank god for earplugs - they really muted the sound, which would no doubt be unbearable without them.\n\nAfter about 30 minutes of lying perfectly still I came out of the chamber and was told by the technician that my doctor would have results within a week. And that was it! Done.","useful":15}

When I moved to Vegas, I went form going out 1-2 nights a week, all the way to 2:30AM to going out EVERY night, racing (and losing) the sunrise home. I had to go thru all kinds of elaborate methods to avoid my fellow nightlife junkie friends when getting out of work and to not know what was going on that night. \n\nBelieve it or not, despite your best efforts, you meetup with friends you always hang with and itch to booze it up. Once- twice a quarter, there is surprisingly \"nothing\" going on, despite every bar/ club themed night. You know because you've posted and checked everyone else's statuses on your phone and came up eh.\n\nGolden Grill is one of the most common places we wound up when this happened when there wasn't enough, uh, dramatization to check out on Fremont St. It was something of a power station. Not Bang a gong, but that's awesome if you got that. \n\nThe grill was either a half time snack before our dressed up band of revelers came up with a cool gig or maybe pronounce the night. Well, maybe check out the bar next to it in the casino. Going home to sleep in Vegas is like x100 the sadness of not having messages waiting for you on your phone when you check it. \n\nI even came up with a name for my closest circle of a dozen friends, making me 13. I even designed badges for us on an engraver website. Someday, friends. Wow, maybe I could refer to them that way, as you may have read about some of the 13 already in my reviews... Who are the other dozen Cylons?\n\nIn this case, Golden Grill is something of Agent #6's hangout, Lucky. Another thing about my Vegas friends, I know all of them from a nickname to be surprised by their \"real\" name later. It took me a long time to get the ball rolling when I started facebook, finding out last names. \n\nThe grill and gold Spike were once very scary places to go into. I walked by on those times. I was scared to go in during the DAY time and I've partied in the Western in the 3: hours, as well as the Atomic *bow head in respect*\n\nNow, we joke that Golden Grill remodeled to the 80's at least. \n\nThe food is alright, actually. I have been there myself and sat at the counter enough times to get consistently great service form the graveyard shift, observing the server window area. I think since half the businesses are open all night, the staff will treat you better knowing there's so many options for drunk asses like us. \n\nAt least we don't create a scene and we tip pimp. Our regular server remembers and even hangs with us when it's slow. He knows a lot about how \"things work\" around town like we do. I'm surprised more people don't.\n\nIt's the towns where a few places are open late nite that I've had horrible service, makes no sense. A server can really clean up with a good graveyard rep where the only alt. is drive thru. \n\nGrill is one of the places where people that live at the Siegel Suites get vouchers to redeem, a meal every day. I have seen them occasionally, I don't think I'd ever go here during traditional dinner rush hours, must be a torch and pitchfork crowd situation then. \n\nThis place entered my mind lately because I would love to have problems now, like winding up at Golden Grill.

But somehow I missed a refurbishing and was surprised to see News channel 8 do a story on it. It looks like a 50's malt shop now, and has expanded about 15 people's worth if you've been in there before. \n\nYou can see how it used to look like by looking at the floor. It's black and white tiled, but under the counter where they employees stand is the drab floor it used to be. And look at the ceiling tiles, you can see the cutoff from the restaurant to the pharmacy, the old faded yellow color used to be above the diner as well. Looks like it was stained from age and cigarettes. (Incidentally, it looks like original painting work on the back wall of the pharmacy.)\n\nThere were 2 guys working the restaurant: a cook/ cashier and a server/ busser/ cashier. After the news piece, I believe they weren't prepared for the rush we experienced when we were there. there were a lot of older people there, we were probably the youngest. But no one minded, this was an environment where people weren't jerks about planning their 20 minute break in a full service restaurant. People didn't mind waiting just out of wanting the \"reopening\" of the place to do well, economy and employment considered.\n\nSome tables weren't bussed, in fact I wanted to help the guy and clean some up so more people could sit. Wonder if they'll add on a new person...\n\nThe best part was the food! They changed the menu, they used to have some Chinese food and the fried rice was my favorite. I hope they eventually bring that back. But they have burgers, Philly's, hot dogs, soda fountain, breakfasts. They don't appear to be open for dinner anymore, which was when I went the most. But I have spent some mornings regretting what I had done the night before my hangover over their breakfasts.\n\nI had the Pizza Philly, which was EXCELLENT, light, crispy bread. We shared a fries and a choc shake, mmade with real ice cream. If they had a host/ cashier, they could be allocated to blending the desserts, too. (I worked at a Marie Callendar's long ago where that worked out fine.)\n\nOh, I got their take out menu *skimming*\n\nThey are open 8:00AM to 3:00PM, and even feature free wi-fi, which is interesting. The lady up front at the register for the Pharmacy couldn't even accept credit cards because they didn't have a phone line to connect their card reader machine to.\n\nI noticed a lot of tug of wars between technology and vintage in this place. I hope they maintain the best of both.

Lite after the Lakers win the Championship.\n\nSo, I wasn't able to go to Taco El Gordo, but it certainly was foremost on my mind. I felt like I was cheating on my date by dreaming of the accommodating, doting and comforting restaurant I made hot monkey dinner with weeks ago. \n\nAdmittedly, the first time I went PAST?? Gordo was with trepidation. The place where the now legend resides is a place where a couple of businesses ago, I got to go out with the first (of 4, so far) Vegas bartenders I had gone out with. The location tanked after construction halted on Echel-outofluck. (Construction workers also gott busted for drinking during lunch). So businesses got a rep of not lasting long near the intersection.\n\nNearby, if you can't stay in business selling espresso & cwof-fee in lingerie, that's tough times depression. Even the jewel of Baker, Ca. The Mad Greek couldn't survive at this very location. (They did better at a couple of off strip locations).\n\nBut this last time I was near, there were lines OUT the door. And this was not one line but 6 wide in the building. And there wasn't 1 pissed off person in the place, we were all salivating over the smells of the grill like zombies surrounding a chess competition (BRAAIINS). \n\nThe tacos looked great, but honestly, I've had those before at other places. When I find a special restaurant, I want the big sampler for variety. There wasn't really one, so I decided to get the largest thing on the menu, the carne asada fries. And normally the few times I eat meat, I get chicken. But since the beef wasn't ground, I got that. As delicious as the spicy pork looked being sliced off the gorgeous hunk of rotating abodada, pork always celebrates a little too much and pisses off my stomach's downstairs neighbors.\n\nAnd then, AND THEN, as if that weren't enough, I got something to drink and not only found horchataaaaaah, which I love, but also a long lost friend beckoned from the past that I had not seen in decades: ORANGE BANG, the bastard cousin of the Orange Whip, also on the endangered list. Give to World Wildlife Fund generously to save or stun, tag and monitor the mating habits of these beautiful beasts.\n\nSo I got carne asada fries. As much as I would love yelp to have a MotherF'er button I know it would get abused, but here it's quite applicable. The benches outside were rightfully packed, so I plopped unceremoniously on the astroturf putting green they had nearby. I positioned myself as to where I could see the most women standing in limos hollering WOOOO as I could see. \n\nThere I was sitting, looking at my dinner, actually star struck. I think pictures of food are helpful on yelp, but the actual process of taking pics of your food is odd and strange. Take pics of your food like no one's watching? And yet there I was taking pics, reciting \"this is my carne asada fries. There are many others like it, but this one is mine to devour until I am picking bits of it out of my eyebrows.\"\n\nI took before and aftermath pics of the carnage of disheveled paper and styro goods. I was full 2/3's of the way, so I sat for awhile and then resumed until I finished every rigoddamn delicious fry and bit of veg there was. \n\nThere are 4 other mexican food places I love in all of Vegas.

Even if it's windy, we linger at the outdoor railings looking at the different parts of town, pointing out places we've lived and worked. \n\nI mostly thought of Vegas' past, what it used to be. There's what it is now and what it could be.\n\nAll of the buildings with pink rooftops (except for 2) are dirty adult places, you know. It's fun picking them out.\n\nRecently I needed to think, so I pulled this footage out. I thought of things that people did when faced with oppression against their Goliaths and outnumbered organizations. \n\nA strong community base, people brought together by music, booking a party for your kid at a local attraction, peaceful rallying, festivals, bringing their pets out and of course, going on vacation to Vegas is some of the things people do deal with things. \n\nI love Vegas, even the Strip, because you can see people in all walks of their life. This is even true on the top of Strat. You have people on the scary rides, all of which I have done with my hands open in the air and eyes wide open, giving myself to the open sky hundreds of feet below. You have people watching because they didn't want to go \"I'll just hold our stuff\" deep on the inside observation area. \n\nPeople are on dates, people are enjoying their retirement. People are waiting to be relieved for break. Parents are holding their little kids comforting them. Don't worry, it's safe to be that high.

Since it was midsummer, the flowering plants were shedding a bunch of buds and who knows what else so they were falling all over everyone outside the entire time we were there.  Several people even opted to move because it was just too much falling flora for them to enjoy their meal.  \n\nThe tapas menu wasn't huge, the prices were pretty high considering it's like one or two bites of food, and the food was only OK.  I ordered a few tapas and ended up ordering more because it just wasn't enough food.  If I had been sharing with more than one person we would have run up a pretty high bill because we would have had to order multiple servings of each item just to give each person a bite of the dish.  The drinks were decently priced. \n\nHonestly, I think the most upsetting thing about this place was the service.  It was a pretty busy summer weeknight in this place and there was ONE waitress for the entire place (inside and outside).  It was really hard to get refills and to place orders for extra food because she was stretched so thin she was barely around to help customers.  Definitely not her fault but put a damper on our experience here because we couldn't even get her attention when we needed something.

Bruce's Mill Conservation Area is open year-round for hikes and other activities. This year's festival was the 42nd of its kind!\n\nOnce you find parking amid the SUVs (seriously - our car was one of the only non-minivans/SUVs in the parking lot), head towards the main area and check out the free petting zoo, filled with goats, sheep, llamas, donkeys and pot-bellied pigs. I'll bet you didn't know that goats are as soft as kittens and that a potbellied pig's hair is coarse and wiry! All of the animals are very friendly and you can freely pet them as they'll come up to the edge of the pen to check you out. There are also guided pony rides for $3. The ponies looked tired. :(\n\nThen head inside to the restaurant, where you can have a pancake breakfast for dirt cheap - I believe for 4 people it came out to $8 for a stack of pancakes, drinks and sausage links with maple syrup, and we couldn't even finish the pancake plate. If you're childfree you'll be in the minority so bring patience and/or earplugs, maybe steeltoe boots for the inevitability of getting slammed by stroller wheels.\n\nFinally, gather around the firepit for the hourly guided tours and stick to the front so you can hear all of the riveting information that the tour guides share along the walk. Alice, our guide, has been leading the tours for two years and she was filled with fun and quirky facts about the production of maple syrup over the years as well as some interesting dendrological information. Along the way we met Katherine, the First Nations guide who explained the early heating methods for sap and the bartering systems they once employed, Martin, who explained what goes into each step of the process and the way that neighbours once shared the profits from maple syrup production, and Bill, the off-season Santa Claus, who showed us the modern-day extraction and production techniques and shared with us that 70% of maple syrup sold comes from Quebec.\n\nIn the adjacent shop you can buy maple products like fudge, maple lollipops and other candies and maple syrup tins and glass bottles. I noticed that some of the bottles are the same ones you can buy in the basement at St. Lawrence Market so there was no rush to buy them here.\n\nAt Bruce Mill's Conservation Area there are four types of maple trees, and the sugar maple produces sap that is much sweeter than the other varieties. Most of the trees are not distinguishable other than by the leaves, and the sugar maple leaf is the one that's on the Canadian flag (who knew??). Speaking of fun facts, maple syrup production is currently only one fifth what it was at the turn of the 20th century.\n \nThe only thing that could have made the tour itself better would be a separate adults-only tour. As expected there were a lot of SUV strollers not conducive to hiking in the woods as well as toddlers with limited attention spans (recall: 1 hour walk) and questionable walking technique/supervision.\n\nGuided One Hour Maple Syrup Walk:\nAdults - $8\nSeniors & Kids - $6\nKids 4 and under - FREE\nGroups of 20 or more, private tour - $6.56 (call 416-667-6295 to reserve)\n\n** STOWville","useful":14}

It's in an unassuming little shopping center on Tatum across the street from PV Mall.  I noticed the sign but never thought twice about going in until my friend Deborah recently told me that they have wonderful sandwiches and salads that are perfect for picking up when you're on the run.\n\nSo, instead of trusting Deborah 100% (I don't know her THAT well yet), I sent my mom in to try Breadcrafters when she asked me where she should go for lunch during her last visit.  It passed the 'mom test' with flying colors... my mom loved it - she said it was perfect!\n\nToday was my turn... and needless to say, I was extremely impressed!  The staff was really sincere, friendly and helpful.  When I walked in, I smelled fresh bread and I saw several cases full of not only bread, but sandwiches, salads, and baked goods too!  Everything looked awesome!  I looked at the menu and noticed that prices were reasonable and they offered daily specials including soup/sandwich combo and 'the daily double' where you pick two different items to make your own combo.  It took me a few minutes. but I decided to design my own sandwich off the menu... I went with turkey, lettuce, tomato. avocado., sprouts, and spicy mustard on multi-grain alsatian bread.  It came with my choice of sides (I went with coleslaw) and a pickle.\n\nIf you've read my reviews, you know I don't usually go into detail about the food more than saying what I ordered, liked, didn't like. etc... however, I have to make an exception on this one.  The sandwich may sound like any other sandwich you could pick up anywhere, but this sandwich was special!  Every bite I took, I tasted all of the ingredients.  It was balanced perfectly!  Just the right amount of mustard and avocado spread evenly on the bread, fresh and juicy turkey. crisp lettuce, and ripe tomato.  Yum!\n\nI was there after 2 for a late lunch expecting this random place to be empty... but I was wrong.  The place was hopping!  I noticed that people were eating outside (it was a beautiful day) and that Breadcrafters is DOG FRIENDLY!  I also noticed that many people came in just to buy freshly-baked bread.  Not a bad idea - I'll have to remember that for next time we're entertaining!\n\nI overheard Angela. the (new) owner, tell a customer that the bread sold like crazy today, so I imagine the best selection is first thing in the morning...

Each time my co-workers and I come here (which is a lot of times) I notice that it is the father or the son that rings us up.  I think there might be two sons, but I'm not positive.  Usually, the same person that takes our order cooks our food in a tiny, exposed kitchen, and there's just something kinda cool about that.  The older Asian woman, who I assume is the cook's wife, is often sitting at the bar with her laptop and gets up periodically to help her husband (or who I assume is her husband) in the kitchen, and bus a few tables.  It's nice to go into a restaurant, even a little dive down the street from my office, and experience a nice, well lit family place.  I also appreciate that they have the news on most of the TV's, not some ESPN bullshit, and that it's CNN and not Fox.\n\nThe other thing I love about this place is that I can get a 16 oz beer for 2.50 which is a totally perfect lunch time beer.  It's not a pitcher, it's not a tiny glass, it's a perfect cheap beer to drink on my lunch hour even when no one else wants to drink (which is most of the time cause they're like \"ohhh you're an alcoholic, we don't drink on our lunch hour blah blah\").  \n\nI always passed this place and always wanted to go in, not only because I heart wings, but because there's a big picture of a buffalo on the outside and that's just awesome.\n\nAs far as wings go, I can dig the ones here.  I order the Atomic cause I'm literally insane about hot food, I love the delicious pain of the heat and I'm always trying to find the hottest stuff around.  The Atomic don't disappoint, yet I would say that the Long Wong's suicide are way hotter, but that's not a complaint really, since most people are sane and don't enjoy scorching their mouth in hopes to FEEL SOMETHING.  This is why I'm on Prozac. \n\nI usually don't order the wings here, not because they're not good, but because sometimes I feel weird eating saucy meat off a bone in front of my co-workers.  Like, I have to be fucking you to really show you that side of my disgusting self.  So I've tried a few different things.  I've gotten the mozzarella sticks a few times and they're pretty awesome as far as fried cheese goes.  The fries are also always awesome, made fresh and hot and perfect and not all fancied up or done down, just fried potatoes made to order like it should be. \n\nThe worst thing I got here were the chicken nuggets.  They were obviously frozen, kinda spongey, kinda gross.  Yet, the next time we came here the nuggets were OFF THE MENU, and in their place were NEW CHICKEN STRIPS.  Which, naturally, I ordered and were totally better, crispy, juicy, a little spicy.  See, family places like this, they consult, they think, they know when shit sucks, and they fix it.\n\nThey have a lunch special which my co-worker orders EVERY time; six wings and fries and a drink for about seven bucks. \n\nBuffalo Brown's can be a little off putting at first.  It's pretty much always empty and the few employees (the family) don't exactly seem totally stoked about your presence, but they always deliver on quality and service.  Also, there's a jukebox and a pool table in the back and while on most days neither of these items are in use, in fact they seem dusty, recently we were winging and beering here when a couple of people started blaring some hip hop music in the tiny, Asian family owned wing joint and it seemed bizarre, but oddly cinematic. \n\nI think I even saw the straight laced Asian cook bobbing his head a little.","useful":4}

I read the reviews that came before mine, and tried to be optimistic too... \n\nAnd while it appears that GG has addressed the complaints about not being vegetarian or food allergy friendly, they can't do much about the chain feeling one gets upon dining here.  They can, however, work on their service, which was unattentive and unorganized during my visit.\n\nMy friends and I went up to prepare our bowls at the buffet.  I prepared mine with shrimp, calamari, imitation crab meat, vegetables, egg, and a mix of honey soy and spicy sauce.  I handed it over to be cooked up and put on brown rice, and it actually turned out pretty decent.  I ended up deciding I wanted to go up for seconds.  This was after our waiter just threw our check down at our table without asking if we wanted anything else.  My friends went for dessert and I went for another bowl after that.  I guess our waiter took the check back when we flagged him down to let him know this.  I was busy finding the hostess to request a new bowl for my second helping.  \n\nI had to ask several times after that for some more water, and when I was waiting for my cooked food to be delivered, the food runner attempted to deliver the wrong bowl to my table, even admitting that sometimes they get the numbers mixed up... not a good sign.  \n\nIf you like dining at places like Sweet Tomatoes, (not that there is anything wrong with that... I even hit up Sweet Tomatoes every now and then), this place could be up your alley.  At dinner, it's $9.99 for one trip to the buffet and $13.99 for a bottomless bowl.  If you drink and/or have dessert though, it can get pricey for what it is, but again, the concept is solid... there is something for everyone to choose from whether you like meat, chicken, fish, noodles, rice, etc...  I would suggest GG do a better job with training their servers and keeping the buffet bar stocked and clean.  I'd also suggest they do something with recipes for sauces as we all just guessed on how much sauce to use and made our own combinations of ingredients.\n\nI have experienced better, but I'm not saying I'd never go back.

It took about 30 minutes for the chili to arrive but I have no doubt that it was because it was being made from scratch, and it was well worth the wait. It was brimming with beans...chickpeas, kidney, black beans...and some sort of bulghur or quinoa base that was unusual and tasty.

The bar nearby I used to love because I remember during a Halloween, they'd leave 1 tap for a seasonal beer. Hope they still do that.\n\nOne of the places I visited most, I stopped by for a quick beer on my Strip Crawl. The lounge was where I'd unwind and got away from the casino chain that I worked for in the area. \n\nMy ritual when I went was to drop a full 3 credit spin on Megabucks. I know a few people on the Strip that did that, we all wished to be put up in a room so we could call our boss the next morning with the news of our abrupt end of services. \n\nThere was a different band playing from the one I remember, I wondered if they still had a gig somewhere on the strip. My copy of the neon was in my room. \n\nI know of this theme park that would paint the rides different colors every few years, paint a new sign with the ride's name on it. We knew it was the same rides every year. So what would make or break the renovations were the employees. The bartender was pretty decent, above \"basic.\" I used to stare up and wondered if anyone really polished the brass trim on the ceiling. It's all painted over with white.\n\nI paid attention as I was strolling thru the casino. Dealers and other employees seemed to help out guests.

Service is top notch and the food is the best quality I've found in the state and beyond.\n\nStarting with drinks, there are plenty to choose from.  I am a dirty martini girl and they make a mean one here.  It's actually two for the price of one, since they bring you the entire shaker and refill it when necessary.  Awesome wine list as well.\n\nIn addition to the complimentary bread bowl which comes with my favorite pretzel rolls in town, my fave appetizers are their oysters, calamari, and seafood tower if you're with a group.\n\nNext up, I am a huge proponent of the Mastro's House Salad.  Tip: it's large, so my recommendation is to share it with someone.  If not, you could easily make a meal of the salad, the bread bowl, and a drink!\n\nAnd for the main course, if you're going with steak, go for the Bone-In Ribeye, and if you're more in the mood for fish, I say Chilean Seabass all the way... you can split either of these also.

Having said that, it will change in time.  If Echelon Place (a Boyd Gaming project) and some of the other projects that were once slated for development come to fruition, Wynn will become prime.  There is still activity down there, but it's slow at this time.  I don't know when Fountainbleu is due to open, but that will certainly help.  Wynn is between the Palazzo/Venetian and The Encore, which is Wynn's newest property.\n\nI only give 4 stars because as much as I like Steve Wynn and what he has done for Las Vegas, I don't really try stay here that often.  There is nothing really \"wrong\" with the property, I just prefer his older masterpiece down the street.  In any other city, this is a 5-star place.  In Vegas, there are so many options it is hard to stay loyal for long.  However, if you are a whale of a gambler, get ready because Steve knows how to treat his high-end clientele.\n\nAs far as the property is concerned, there is a lot to see and do.  Le Reve is a fantastic show that I have seen twice.  I have not seen the other shows and don't even know what they currently are showing.  I know Spamalot was there, but moved on.\n\nShopping at The Wynn is nice.  Think high-end boutiques as there really isn't anything else.  I always enjoy a walk through the Ferrari dealership.  There is an admission fee, but it is waived if you own a Ferrari.  Who says there aren't great deals in Vegas?\n\nIf you need \"regular shopping\" the Fashion Show Mall is directly across the street, which is very convenient.  They have everything.  Nordstrom's, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, and several hundred other stores, topped off with a food court.\n\nWynn has ambiance.  Encore, next door, has even more ambiance.  They are both fantastic places to gamble, hang out and people watch, or dine.  You don't have to stay at The Wynn to enjoy the best of what it has to offer which is probably why I don't stay here often.\n\nThe first time I stayed here was opening night.  It was a nice stay, but they weren't ready.  The television remote wasn't in the room yet, things weren't properly programmed on the phone, etc.  That was all fixed within a few weeks when I returned.\n\nThe basic rooms are a decent size, and have all of the high-end features you would expect from a new property that cost billions (literally) to create.  Flat-screen televisions, luxurious bed linens, a nice lounge area, and a lovely bathroom with water closet.  Very nice, but not the best buy on The Strip.  I recall these rooms starting at $359, but who knows what they are getting in June '09.\n\nThe Tower Suites are much nicer, but they are pricey for what you get.  If you are a good rate shopper in this price range, you are likely going to steer towards another property (Skylofts, Four Seasons, etc.).  The few times I stayed in a suite at The Wynn, it was in a Salon Suite.\n\nThe rooms feature a very cool design with a wonderful entertaining space complete with a full bar.  The bedrooms are full-blown luxury and the bathroom is larger than the bedroom.  The only thing I thought was weird were the benches in the rain shower.  It forced me to think about how well it had been cleaned since the last seating, which shouldn't matter since I don't sit in the shower.  Anyway, think luxury, not bench.  The Salon Suite is also quite large (just under 2000 sq ft), but the space could be used for so much more, in my opinion.  One of the suites did have a cool massage room in it.  The other did not.  All of the lights and curtains are electronically controlled througout these spaces.\n\nThe restaurants and great and the room service is great.  They did not cut corners here when I was staying with them and I doubt they do today, at least in the food department.  Everything was served to perfection, even in the room.  That is not easy to do.\n\nI can also tell you that they have several clubs with quite a scene on certain nights.  I have never wanted to go to XS, which is more the bottle service type of place, but if I was in the Vegas club mood and looking to blow some money on booze, I would check it out.  Tryst, on the other hand, held my attention for a bit and is worth going back to.  That bar/club is located just in front of the waterfall.  A must for one drink.\n\nOverall, my advice is to spend time here, gamble here, eat here, and see a show or two here.  If you stay here, have a reason.  If the reason is you want to dine and see shows on property, by all means stay here.  If you are on a budget or want to get the most over-the-top suite for a decent price, look around and just visit.  There are always numerous hotel options in Vegas.  Regardless, visit the property as it is truly worth it.","useful":2}

The majority of our guests stayed on-site and although we live only ten minutes away, we checked in for the weekend as well.  The staff was friendly and extremely accommodating.

She worked with us on room rates for our guests, ceremony and reception details, menu, bar, decor, and more... She's since been promoted and Kelly was brought into the picture, but it was a seamless transition.  \n\nSure, I could nit pick about a few of our guests not receiving hospitality bags, housekeeping coming in crazy early to clean rooms, or the fact that the sorbet (intermezzo course) was served prematurely and melted before most were able to enjoy it... but these things are to be expected at such a large scale event, and I'm extremely satisfied at how the weekend went.

The wedding itself was amazing as was the Sunday brunch that we had poolside.  The bell staff were fabulous and there are a few other staff that went above and beyond that I must mention by name:\n-Aleisha, the concierge - she was overly friendly and helpful throughout the weekend; especially on our wedding day when we needed a last minute place for make-up.  She also brought us much needed bottles of water and was super sweet to Minnie!\n-Tom, Joya Fitness Director - he allowed us to use the spin bikes to have a private little wedding day spin class that my friend Karle taught... it was the perfect way to start my special day!\n-Julio - my personal butler for the day...

The remodeled Tropicana offers exactly that. The room that my boyfriend and I stayed in was very spacious and nice with almost all the amenities a person could need. The room was very clean - no bed bugs or questionable stains. The furniture was all very comfortable and conducive to a good nights rest. The decor was fun and was the perfect theme for our spring break. We were also very surprised by the very large soaking tub in the bathroom. \n\nOur room was great, but there were a couple of cons. I would suggest that they invest some money on mini refrigerators for the rooms. When you spend 150$ on a gourmet meal and cannot finish the whole thing, it's sad to have to throw it away because you cannot properly refrigerate it. It would also be nice if they put coffee makers in the rooms. I read other reviews that mentioned that one could be requested, but even if that is the case, it still seemed odd, since that comes standard in most rooms. They also should not tell customers that their tower has a garden view when it does not. We did not pay for the strip view, so when they said we were in the tower overlooking the pool and gardens I was just fine with that, since their gardens are beautiful. We had a view of the airport. Nothing but tarmac baby! It's not a huge deal, but I appreciate honesty. \n\nThe overall hotel looks very nice, and I am sure it will look even better once they are completely finished remodeling. The pool area was very nice, and will be awesome once Nikki beach is finished. It was still a bit too cold in March to spend a long time in the pool, but the large hot tubs were fun. I am not a gambler, so I really could care less that the casino area was smaller than the others. People should realize that it does not matter the size, since they all take your money just the same! I cannot really comment on the restaurants. We did eat brunch at Cafe Nikki. I thought the restaurant looked very beautiful, but thought it was overpriced for what they were serving ($11 for my scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, and hash browns and $12 for my boyfriends cheeseburger), but I guess everything in Las Vegas is overpriced. The hotel staff seemed very friendly, but I only saw them when we checked in and out, so I cannot really comment on that either. \n\nI would say that our overall stay was very nice.

Not only are the flightlines themselves amazing and fun, the staff and guides are truly fun and friendly people to spend a few hours with. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with them, as did my friend who is local to Vegas.\n\nI called in to book my reservation and dealt with Amber on the phone.  She was very sweet and acommodating as we changed our minds on the time and date once after the initial booking.  She said no problem, which showed us that they are very customer service oriented.\n\nWhen we went, our guides were Todd, Sean and Dave  We spent most of our day with Todd because he was the one who prepared our gear and launched us from the top of each line.  Sean and Dave were at the bottom of the line catching us so they stayed rather busy.\n\nWhen you arrive at the facility on Industrial Road, you go through a quick safety briefing, which includes signing a waiver.  There isn't much too the briefing as the process is really quite simple.  After that, they load you in the truck for a quick ride up the mountain.  In the van, the guides were telling jokes as well as stories about the history of Bootleg Canyon and how it got the name.  Very cool.\n\nOnce the truck can't go any further, there is a short (20 minute) hike to the very top.  On the day we went, it was only about 90 degrees, and they gave us a break at the half way point.  Our group had a child as young as 11 with his parent and adults up to middle-age.  Everybody was able to handle it without any problem.  The guides have bottled water packed for everybody.\n\nAt the top, there is a great view.  Looking down the lines may seem intimidating for some, but it really didn't bother me or my friend.  We opted to go in the first group of four since nobody else volunteered.  All I can say is that the ride is really smooth, fast, and fun!  There is little vibration on the ride...it is smooth!  My friend said the wind was drying his contacts when at full speed, but I didn't have that problem.  By the second run, even the most frightened rider at the top of line one was full of confidence and ready to continue.\n\nThe guides, who were going down backwards and upside down, said that the speeds we experienced were close to 70MPH.  It sure didn't feel that fast, but I am certain it was because one run was half a mile long and only lasted 60 seconds.  Keep in mind, you start out going zero.\n\nThere are four runs in total.  Each run takes about 30 minutes as the lines have to be prepared for each rider.  There is quite a process involved in between each ride because they have to reset the brakes, which lessen the impact when you come into the landing station.  While waiting, there is plenty of time to take in the views, chat with other guests or joke with the guides.\n\nOn the last run, the guides will take your camera and video or snap photos of you coming down the line.  I thought that was really nice since most places would just take your photo with THEIR camera and charge you an arm and a leg for one print.  Once again, great customer service.\n\nEverybody in our group had fun.  I want to go back now and do it at night!!!","useful":7}

That is where they throw the bottles, etc.  Anyway, it is worth seeing once, at the very least.  Some of the best in the world showcase their talents here.\n\nThe casino is OK.  They do not have the cheap tables you find at Bills, Casino Royale and O'Sheas, but they have a nice selection of games if you are willing to play twice as much per hand.  For me, I like the cheap tables.  You can always bet more!  If I am going to pay double, I do that at the Bellagio, Wynn or Venetian where I feel it is worth it.  The service and amenities make up for the fact that you pay double to gamble there.  At Harrah's, it should be the same minimums as the neighbors on that side of the street.  It is not a luxury property, and it doesn't try to claim to be.\n\nAs for restaurants and shows, they have a few options but none that really appeal to me.  If you are a Toby Keith fan, you might be in luck as they have a bar and grill that bears his name.  Rita Rudner is the headliner for entertainment.  It used to be Toni Braxton.  I am not exactly sure who the demographic is that they are targeting, but I can assure you that it isn't me.","useful":0}

And it's fucking gross. \n\nOn our way home from work I told the boyfriend we should check out somewhere new for happy hour simply because I needed a new Yelp review to write.  He was reluctant to try this shit hole, pressuring me to simply enjoy a few beers at Casey Moore's instead of wanting something \"new.\"\n\n\"But I need to yelp.\"\n\nWalking into Buffalo Wings and Rings is sad and disappointing and you already know it's going to suck.  There was no one in the place and the decor consists of sports jersey's thumb tacked to a wall and three or four dated flat screen TV's showing a bunch of bullshit no one is watching.  'Cause no one is there. \n\nWe're greeted by a faux punk rock chick with a horrible fire engine red dye job which was unflattering for that A-Line haircut she paid too much for at Tony and Guy.  She was obviously new to the whole \"serving\" thing which is probably why she was working on a Wednesday night when everyone was watching the premier of American Idol.  We asked if we could sit outside as the inside was dreary and unwelcoming, like my Grandpa's house on Christmas. \n\nBuffalo Wings and Rings has the ugliest and most uncomfortable plastic, grade school-esque chairs I've ever seen.  The tables are also ugly, plastic, wobbly and adorned with tree droppings and uncleaned ashtrays.  \n\nThe boyfriend gives me an \"I told you so\" look as we move around trying to find a clean table and one in which we're not getting hit with hot air by some weird, loud buzzing fan.  We finally settle at a sticky table with an uncleaned, smelly ashtray. \n\nI ask Faux Punk Server about their specials; 2.50 domestic pints, nothing good on draft, no food specials, no well specials.  I order a Michelob Ultra as I have little other choice.  We wait too long.  Faux Punk Server comes back, \"Oh, keg is empty, have to refill, can you wait?\"  \n\nWe wait longer, we get our beers.  We look at the shitty, over priced Buffalo Wild Wings rip off of a menu.  I hate the whole \"pick your flavor, then pick your heat\" thing they do at some wing places.  It seems odd and, um, retarded.  I order five sweet and sour with the \"atomic\" sauce, the boyfriend get original buffalo \"extra hot.\"\n\nI feel it necessary to mention that when we got our wings they all tasted exactly the same.  A thin layer of Frank's Red Hot on gross, old, frozen wings served in plastic bowls.  At one point I spit a piece out because it tasted like ground beef.  \n\nWe also had the pleasure of their \"signature item,\" Sloppy Fries.  These were frozen french fries served, again, in a giant plastic bowl covered with canned chili and fake nacho cheese.  It literally looked like a bowl of vomit.  Like, someone ate a bunch of McDonald's hamburgers and fries and then threw it up in a bowl and set it down on the table for us.  We ended up having this wrapped up so I could give it to my dog.  He liked it a lot.  But as the boyfriend later pointed out, \"he also licks his asshole a lot.\"  \n\nIronically, Faux Punk Server said as she sat them down, \"these look SO good.\"\n\nAs it turned out, nothing here was good or redeeming.  Even the server, though she tried her best, fumbled over her words, nervously took our plates and couldn't make eye contact.  The entire place reeked of low-ball, less than nothing American shit food and the emptiness of the dining area soon become the emptiness of my FUCKING SOUL as I dished out thirty bucks to spit shit out and bitch for an hour. \n\nAs we left the place I told the boyfriend he was right, we should have just gone to Casey Moore's and not given into my now costly desire to try something new for a stupid Yelp review.

This downtown Calgary location was no exception.\n\nI'm not normally a \"pink person,\" but \"pink flamingo\" and \"pink lemonade\" are two tea flavors at David's that haven't let me down.  Both herbal without caffeine, tart with a natural sweetness, and good hot or cold, I'm a huge fan.  If these don't appeal to you though, I am sure you'll find something that does - David's Tea has so many options!\n\nIt's worth noting that there are limited seating options at all of the locations I've been to, but this one happens to have a few tables in front by the window.  I lucked out and scored one on my recent visit.  I sat and sipped my tea and people-watched a bit before a meeting I had and it was perfect.\n\nThe stores are typically bright and they also sell some great tea-related gifts and accessories as well.

Because it's in the BARRIO??? HAHHAHAHAH.\n\nIt's interesting walking by graffiti marked brick walls and chipped away pawn shop signs into a seemingly upscale restaurant with live music and ridiculously priced tacos.  We got a good table on a Friday night and ordered margaritas and the Queso dip to start.  Our server was attentive and straight forward but seemed detached and unhappy.  Like he got called into work that night but really wanted to be playing World of Warcraft and taking bong hits.  \n\nAlso, why serve bread with salsa as a complimentary app instead of chips and salsa? Are you too classy for chips and salsa, Barrio? You have to be \"different\" by giving us white bread which is horribly filling before a meal? Nonetheless, the salsa concoction was super tasty so I DID in fact eat some white bread with it then I gained 14 pounds then I ate some tacos after.  \n\nThe margaritas were pretty perfect and I can always appreciate when they're served in cheap Ikea glasses instead of traditional margarita glasses because margarita glasses are, you know, pointless and difficult to handle especially after you've had, like, seven.  Though I'd never order seven margaritas at Barrio because I'm poor and this place is not for poor people. \n\nI got the carnitas tacos and the boyfriend had the carne asada ones.  We swapped a taco each and while they were both cooked perfectly and rather delightful, nothing was very spicy, and I craved heat in everything we ordered.  It's Mexican food, yo, where's the spice?  \n\nThe ambiance is nice and soothing with hip art and yuppie conversations abound.  The live music was a nice touch and the bathrooms were neat-o; a seemingly ironically decorated homage to cheesy Mexican restaurants, fully equipped with tacky crucifixes and hotel art paintings of the Virgin Mary.  I loled as I peed. \n\nFor both of us to eat there, two drinks each, two entrees and one app it was a little over a hundred bucks.  Which is why I only give Barrio three stars because while everything was pretty good, it was not a 100 dollar meal.  I feel I could find a hole in the wall authentic Mexican place right around the corner and get a few pretty awesome pork street tacos, and while maybe they won't have the same quality nor will I be able to listen to soothing Mexican guitar and lol at the ironically decorated bathroom, at least I'll still have gas money for the week.","useful":5}

We've had some wonderful conversations and like others I've definitely been getting the \"regular\" treatment. They knows people's names when they arrive and what they usually order. The staff is all decked out in soccer shirts and bandanas and seem to vibe together really well, like old high school pals.\n\nCrap, three paragraphs in and I haven't even made note of the food.\n\nWhenever I think of the word burrito I think of the French verb \"bourrer\" - to stuff, but actually, more than just stuffing. Literally toppling over and filling every pore. That's the kind of satisfaction you get after eating a Chino Locos burrito. These monsters weigh at least a few pounds and are expertly folded, grilled and wrapped. Ask them to cut it in half for you since it can get a bit unwieldy because so much is stuffed inside.\n\nMy tried & true order is the basa fish burrito. Basa fish is a catfish native to Vietnam and Thailand, and as you can see from the other reviews of Chino Locos, they dole out Mexican-Asian fusion burritos. The fish portion is substantial and it's poached really nicely and has a deadly texture. The burritos all come with a junkload of standard fillings - no 50 cents extra nonsense for any of these - black bean spread, cilantro, onions, rustic rice (or chow mein), edamame beans, peppers, guacamole, sour cream and cheese. I (obviously) opt for no cilantro or onions in mine. \n\nBurritos are $6.99 ($7.90 after tax) and there is a weekly meat special, such as General Tao, boneless ribs, pulled pork, etc. They also have a vegan burrito and a dessert burrito. Call ahead for pickup to save time. And yeah, like Greg C said, their burritos beckon you mere minutes after finishing them. Whenever I'm hungry and thinking \"what should I eat\" the craving usually leads me to Chino Locos. \n\nMy new favourite burrito in the city.","useful":14}

There's also the soup of the day.\n\nWhen I used to eat meat I never swayed from my precious \"Linguini with Grilled Chicken in Sun-dried Tomato Garlic Cream Sauce\". The dinner portion is hefty and yields more than enough for a leftovers split. Nowadays I tend to order the Cheese & Spinach Cannelloni - it comes with a creamy tomato sauce with melted mozzarella on top. The Butternut Squash Agnoloti (kind of like ravioli) are also excellent and a lot lighter as the sauce isn't cream-based. \n\nQueen's Pasta is a great dining experience if you're with friends and want to linger over a drawn out meal. There is also an upstairs that you can reserve for larger parties as well as an outdoor patio in the summer. I also love that you can purchase their fresh pasta and jarred sauce at the nearby Queen's Pasta Cafe Takeout boutique. \n\nIf I had to make one suggestion it would be to upgrade the front entrance - waiting in that cramped space and being in everyone's way when you stand there is less than ideal.","useful":4}

So please stop penalizing us for choosing non-dairy options.\n\n2. As much as I'm aware of the fact that my chai latte most likely comes from a pre-made mix everywhere, not just at Manic Coffee, I'd rather that reality stay hidden and instead maintain some sort of mystique that a fresh pot of chai tea is being brewed and steamed milk is being added to it. Please don't take the carton of soy milk MIX, chai MIX out from beneath the counter and measure it out in front of me, then pour them together, stir and froth. I'd rather not be reminded of exactly how much I'm paying for you to stir two liquids together and heat them up. Thanks.\n\n3. Way too much nutmeg in the pre-made chai mix they used.

You never know when that might come in handy (nudge nudge).\n\nThe rooms are fantastic.  The hotel check-in occurs on ground level, but the rooms and suites are all located on the top floors of the Mandalay Bay structure.  Again, separate everything including elevator banks.  The only way you will know the Mandalay is there is if you travel through the sound-proof door that separates the two properties in the lobby.  Coming back requires a key, so you do not get lost hotel guests from next door wandering around.\n\nMy suite had a living room, powder bath, a lovely bedroom, and a huge master bath with soaking tub and steam shower.

I've had my eye on you for quite some time.  You popped up in Arcadia and also in Scottsdale on Tatum and Shea.  I finally had the perfect opportunity to try you when my sister suggested we have Mexican for lunch on a recent Monday.\n\nAt the time, we were closer to the Tatum and Shea location, so I headed that way first... only to find a sign on the window that said that the Scottsdale location had closed it's doors.  Bum bum... bummer.  Over to Arcadia I went; at least they would be open and pleased to serve me; or so I thought.\n\nI parked and walked in with excitement, ready to check out this Tex Mex fast casual place with a large order to-go.  The greeting I received was underwhelming... No \"welcome to Uberrito\" -- no \"hello\" or \"have you been here before?\" or \"what can we get started for you today?\"  Instead it was a pressured meat or seafood question. Well, I was ordering a taco, 2 salads, a couple of tortillas, a quesadilla, and some nachos.  We had looked at the menu online in advance and my sister wanted the \"Two Timer\" (Seasoned ground beef, lettuce, tomatoes, & shredded cheese drizzled with sour cream in a crispy taco shell, wrapped in a flour tortilla, spread with refried beans).  Well, strike 2 (or is it 3 at this point? )  This location didn't offer that option and the girl working there looked at me like I was crazy, saying \"we don't have a Two-Timer on the menu.\"  \n\nInstead, I ordered my sister the \"Sloppy Cowboy\" (Shredded beef mixed with grilled potatoes and onions, topped with shredded cheese, drizzled with smoky chile de √°rbol salsa & serrano ranch on a flour tortilla).  Needless to say, it was not a hit.\n\nI made my way down the assembly line and told another employee what toppings to add to the salads, and when I got to the end and went to pay, I asked for some salsa on the side.  You would have thought I asked for sushi at a Mexican restaurant or that my request was super high maintenance based on the response.  \n\nEmployee: \"What kind would you like?  We have seven kinds.\"  \nMe: \"I'd like two medium, two hot, and two mild, please\"\nEmployee: \"Two of each?\"  (while rolling his eyes).\nMe: \"Yes, please.  Unless you have a better suggestion.\" \nNote: There was no offer of a signature salsa, or a recommendation based on our order.\nI received my order and was not shocked to find that we were short a salsa and that one spilled all over the bag.\n\nI probably should have noticed the pattern in previous reviews about the unfriendly attitudes and poor service at this restaurant... It's definitely something that could use some work.  The nachos, quesadilla and salads were fine as I added toppings that were to our liking, but based on service alone, I will not be returning to this restaurant anytime soon.  There are plenty of other moderately priced Mexican restaurants in the Valley who will appreciate your business far more than it appears this place does.","useful":10}

Or, maybe because my friend opened a similar concept called Dressed in Atlanta... either way, I'm the kind of girl that loves a big salad for lunch, and I'm psyched to have a place like tossed here in Arizona...\n\nAs of today, October 10, Tossed has been open just over a week. So I know I can't be too tough on them... when we went a few days ago, they were still getting used to being open. Even so, it was a positive experience.  The space itself is pretty large for a salad restaurant.  I think it used to be an Arizona Bread Company - I hope it does well at this location as I'd love for it to stay!\n\nI was with my brother; I asked if he'd join me for lunch at tossed since I really wanted to try it.  We walked in and figured out to go to the side that was to order in (as the other side was for catering and take out orders) - it was kind of confusing, but we later learned (from Gazwan Paulus, the Area Developer) that bigger signs are on their way.\n\nSince I'd picked up one of the tossed menus before we went, we both were somewhat familiar with it, but it still took me a few minutes at the register to design my own salad from their huge list of ingredients.  Zack chose from the list of \"specialty salads and creative interpretations of familiar favorites\" and ordered the Southwest Blackened Chicken Salad.  I finally chose my unique combo of greens, chick peas, chopped tomato, avocado, turkey, and maybe celery.  I also suggested to Zack that we order one of their whole wheat crepes (that are made fresh in the store to create crepe wrap sandwiches) to share.  After we ordered and payed, we were given a # to bring to the table - I do like the fast casual concept.  However, it was not until after we ordered that we were able to actually see all of the ingredients in front of us - I may have chose differently after seeing everything laid out in front of me...\n\nRegardless, it was only a matter of minutes before  our beautiful salads were delivered to us.  Presentation was beautiful, service was friendly, and best of all, our salads were delicious!  I'd taken the suggestion from Tori (the girl who took our order) to taste the Strawberry Balsamic Vinaigrette as my dressing and it was delicious - Thanks again, Tori!  We were both pleased with what we ordered; the crepes were a light, chewy, unique texture that we both really enjoyed as well.  Somehow a bite or two of cheese made it into my salad which isn't the end of the world, but I knew I hadn't ordered it- I'll let it go since they are still so new.\n\nThere are a ton of other salads that I look forward to designing at tossed and I cannot wait to go back for more!  You may want to check it out online before you go as the menu can be a bit overwhelming.  Prices range from $6.95 - $10.95 but can get even more expensive if you like to add a ton of ingredients.  I'd plan on spending about $10 per person on average.  Not so bad... oh, and they also soup, smoothies, and sweet treats including freshly baked cookies, brownies, and fruit - there is something for everyone.\n\nAs we were leaving, we met the Area Developer I spoke of above and he was really nice... he wanted to make sure we had a good experience and he told us of their plans to build locations of tossed all around the Valley.  I hope they will consider coming to Old Town because that's where I'll be soon!","useful":18}

So after a night of partying at an MMVA afterparty, we were more than ready for some greasy food in the form of sandwiches.\n\nWhen we arrived at King and Bathurst the entire intersection was cordoned off with police tape - surely a typical Friday or Saturday night scene as the clubbing contingency was out in full force and apparently club crime is the 'in thing' these days. But I wanted my Reggie's dammit! And it was only five doors down from where the police tape began. \n\nAfter unsuccessfully negotiating with the cops (\"but we're hungry!\") we called in our order and the folks at Reggie's were more than happy to rhyme off their menu offerings and come out to deliver the food to us in exchange for cash payment. Talk about flexibility!\n\nWe stood on the corner waiting for our order for a few minutes and then got away from the police swarm and took a walk to a back alley for some...peace and quiet. Anyhoodle...it suddenly occurred to one of us that perhaps Reggie's backed onto the very spot that we were loitering, so we called again and the cook came out to let us inside. It was an extremely narrow and crowded path from the kitchen to the front of the restaurant, so we had to be guided one by one. \n\nInside there was a gaggle of customers staring out the window, watching the crime scene across the street unfold. They weren't allowed to leave the restaurant because all of King Street was off limits, and any time someone tried to open the door to get some fresh air or stretch their legs, the police would march over and get scoldy. We saw countless people being ushered out of the club with their hands on their head, some willingly, some dragged, some in handcuffs. It was quite the spectacle. \n\nSo the food...a bunch of my friends ordered chicken and pork sandwiches but I ordered the grilled cheese. It was mega cheesy, gooey and greasy. Definitely late night food. The fries were good but possibly too dry/crispy. They required ketchup. \n\nI will definitely be returning to try the carrot cake and the fried mac and cheese, and hopefully my next visit will be memorable for the food portion only!","useful":7}

As in, if a restaurant is found to be using any ketchup product that's not Heinz, DineSafe should award them a conditional pass till they remedy the situation.\n\nThe thing that puts this place over the edge, however, is the fact that they carry bottled, corn syrup-free (kosher) Coke. I have never seen glass bottled Coke anywhere else in Toronto and the manager confirmed its rarity to me. You can enjoy one with your meal or buy 6 bottles to go for $15.","useful":4}

Until then, I shall fantasize about the day that I start pulling in Oprah-esque figures and owner Jared spends his days gingerly assembling custom healthy meals for me in my home.\n\nNot unlike Camros Eatery's restaurant motto, Calico is the type of place where you \"feel good during AND after eating.\" The rotating lunch menu is vegan but nothing about it screams \"weirdo\" - instead, you'll find yourself struggling to decide on just one thing to order. At $6-7 per main, it's affordable enough that you could order two things, but I dare you to get to the bottom of the plate -- I couldn't!\n\nI ordered a Crispy Tofu Sandwich with Avocado, Tomato, Alfalfa Sprouts and Roasted Red Pepper Spread ($7) that came with a delightful side salad of greens (good ones - no iceberg lettuce here), shaved carrots, tomatoes and slivered almonds. I couldn't quite pinpoint the dressing but it was light, refreshing and perfectly portioned. It's like they knew I didn't like my greens drowning in dressing. The sandwich was grilled 'n pressed and the type that I always daydream about making at home but never do. And as mentioned, I could only finish half the sandwich with the salad, not because it was monstrous and unwieldy, but because it was really filling and slammed with quality ingredients. \n\nI also had my eye on Maple Cumin Tempeh with Tomato Sprouts, Eggplant Chutney and Miso Spread (for next time!) and the daily soup, which Val G warned was what reeled her in as a Calico regular in the first place. \n\nI have to call attention to the presentation of the food - it's gorgeous (see photos). Everything is carefully assembled and photo-op ready. It begs to be captured on film. You almost don't want to ruin it by eating it. In fact, everything about the food here seems inspired and carefully considered. \n\nThey have daily fresh juices (beet & apple yesterday), smoothies (banana & date) as well as an Iced Tea Of The Day. Way to make me fall in love with you. Naturally I had to order a glass of Lavender Mint ($2.50) - it was spectacular and will promptly be added to my list of best iced teas in the city. For $2.50 it was a great value and a very unique flavour that was just slightly sweetened but not cloying. \n\nJared, the owner, was a very kind and gracious host. We chatted about his bustling vegetable garden in the backyard (which gets lots of use in warmer months, but still manages to produce things like kale even in the winter!) and Calico's inventive vegetarian brunch menu of sweet and savoury waffles and omelettes, available on weekends  from 11am-4pm. \n\nBravo, Calico!

I enjoyed a wonderfully romantic (heheh) meal at Mercatto with my pal Jen S. last night and our first introduction to this fine Italian eatery was fabulous. Mercatto could give Terroni or any similar Italian restaurant in Toronto a run for its money with its beautiful decor, rustic dining furniture and stylin' staff. \n\nI started with the soup of the day - a Spicy Tomato and Herb Puree ($5) that arrived at both the perfect temperature and portion for my taste and quickly followed it with one of Mercatto's signature salads - Arugula served with Toasted Walnuts, Roasted Pears, Shaved Pecorino Cheese and a subtle Honey-Citrus Vinaigrette ($8) that was substantial enough for two people to share. \n\nThen came the real chef d'oeuvre of the night - the Gnudi. When I spotted gnudi on the specials menu (which is printed daily on a small scrap of paper) my eyes immediately gravitated towards the gnudi option. Gnudi is means \"naked\" in Italian and the dish is essentially a \"naked ravioli\" that's a hit with gnocchi lovers. It replaces the potato of gnocchi with a soft pillowy ricotta and other savoury ingredients and is baked in a cheesy sauce. This gnudi in particular was made with fresh spinach and ricotta baked in cheese and tomato sauce and served in a small casserole dish. There were seven gnudi in total but they were so incredibly rich I was hardly able to finish half of them! Jen took them home and is probably, at the time of this writing, enjoying them as a sandwich filling for lunch. \n\nFor dessert I ordered a three-tiered Butterscotch Pudding (it had a fancier name than that but I can't find any mention of it on the website) that was served with almond biscotti in a chilled glass. The flavours were layered and each one was increasingly rich and creamy.\n\nWhat I was most impressed with at Mercatto was the massive chalkboard boasting the \"Gido D'Italie\", a weekly culinary tour of Italy that's been ongoing since October 2008. Every Thursday beginning at 5pm Mercatto offers a prix fixe that showcases regional cuisine from a different part of Italy. \n\nThis week the spotlight was on Sardinia (\"Sardegna\"), the second largest island in the Mediterranean Sea that lies just west of Italy. On the menu was Calamari, Spaghetti al'Aragosta, Catalan-Style Tuna Fish with peppers, onions, tomato and potatoes and Almond Cake for dessert. Were I a meat eater you can guarantee I'd be doing the Gido D'Italie every Thursday. What a creative and juicy idea for a weekly dose of flavour for the average Toronto diner!\n\nMercatto has two locations at the moment (this one as well as another on Bay Street) and is opening a third this summer on College just east of University Ave.","useful":4}

I'm reluctant to give it a nickname, since hotels before have tried to reboot themselves with the hip, locals' nickname to disastrous results. Also, tabloids kinda ruined nicknames with the first initial, first syllable of last name formula. \n\nThere are at least a dozen watering holes to wait for people. And while I did this frequently over the years, I'll focus on 2 of the most important times I've done this on property. Once, behind the Bar 46 wall, I hung out at that inside bar when a bride plopped her flowing gown crying self on the stool next to me. Everyone looked, but they didn't want to say anything. They wanted the guy by himself sitting next to her to test the unpredictable waters first. \n\nUnfortunately, my first trip to Golden Nugget was after the Wynn days, the Kenny Rogers (pre Joan Rivers face) entertainment director days and even pre Fremont Street Experience (weekend cruising)/ Jan Jones days. But I have heard the stories many, many times. \n\nI got to experience 2 rich guys trying their hand at running a casino and branding themselves with a reality show era. But, what was cool was that I got to see the reality show broadcast on the canopy when they aired and as a bonus, Tara Reid got to hang out there and I met her fresh during one of her nip slip (read: her entire boob was out for an extended oblivious amount of time) publicized moments.\n\nThe changes over the years have been decent, the Nug seems to be the most financed and first downtown to start the renovations that set the standard for others to follow, which is great. \n\nYou want to know about the bride, but I should begin the second time I waited, too. It was for a guy, yeah yeah. I used to work with him. I hadn't seen him in years, he was always one of those guys we used to give shit to each other at work all the time, hung out at the diamond lounge after work and work some events together. I went to him to get the what for on who's hiring lately.\n\nHe always had 4-5 frames going on at the same time, but he had a bit of a gambling problem that kept him from saving any of it. Great service at the bar, it's the bar next to the cashier window that I think people still shock their hand with that stamp machine trying to validate their parking ticket. The bar is also next to the poker room. We always had a cold rivalry, but our meeting was something of a summit, since I/we finally admitted we were the top 5 competent workers in that over themed restaurant.\n\nBack in the day, I talked to the bride for a bit until we were the center of attention in that corner of the casino, so we left. We walked over to the Hand Of Faith (pre gold vending machine- Wow!), where we gazed and devised a plan to get her out of her hotel room heist style (her fian-psycho parts unknown, BOLO). Ex's are always called psychos, but honestly, isn't that why we hooked up with them to begin with? \n\nWe were able to get some of the people at the bar to canvas the lobby for- wait, what does this have to do with a review of a casino? Random GN patrons banded together to form a rag tag gang, that's what this casino is capable of!\n\nThe shark tank was a great addition and ingenious that they have a water slide thru it. The shock is that they can maintain it without people ruining it somehow with vandalism or an accident of some kind. The bars in the lounge areas flow specialty drinks egregiously. \n\nI suppose I'll have to review the venetian canal ride or the Viva Wedding Chapel to finish about what happened with the ex bride... Man, I didn't even get to meeting Gordie Brown, The Experience in the cafe and the hooker from the heart of Gold Diggers, but they can have their own reviews at least.\n\nGolden Nugget maintains the standard downtown, but The D and Golden Nugget are both up with a bullet!","useful":2}

On my first trip to Vegas there was a square frame of a structure being built at the intersection. By the end of my first 9 day trip, they were erecting a huge mockup of a motorcycle on the front corner of that I-beam frame.\n\nAges ago, it was common to make the Harmon pilgrimage to Hard Rock. Blocks into it, the big go to used to be The Drink. I remember once I got hammered there so much I woke up in a room at Town Hall \"with no idea how I got there.\" I have a lot of Vegas drinking stories that end with that phrase, or pause for the morning after (/of) part.\n\nIt was odd there weren't that many people making the walk. I remember it was crawling with people during summer at least, too cheap for a cab or needed to walk off booze. \n\nOne of  the first times I went to Hard Rock, Morton still owned it. In their nightclub Baby's I met Vince Vaughn, hot off the success of Swingers. This was when we took pictures with film and we couldn't see if/ how the picture turned out til after the trip, from the photo developers. And people only give you one real shot at a pic before people rotate or move on. And the one pic came out shitty.\n\nFrom those first trips, there's always that one server I see at Mr. Lucky's 24/7. The first time I asked her out was when the steak and shrimp special was less than $7 bucks, I think she told me about it when it was actually a secret. \n\nFinished many a drunken night/ morning there. \n\nI was there for the Millennium. I saw Australia ring in the new century, the casino had a light show/ celebration every hour that day & I think 'I ran in the first 3 time zones before meeting up with friends. \n\nOn Halloween, a group of us guys used to go to Hard Rock to see the parade of ineffective bras not holding their cargo as women paraded around the circle of the casino dressed as Slutty [Vocation/ animal].\n\nI've seen many changes of the casino over the years. The new sections of the casino were almost empty and I didn't know if it was a surprise or not. \n\nUnfortunately, I didn't carry enough cash to get a pad of bills. I only know of one other casino that does it: Caesars. It's a cool Vegas-y gift for x-mas, I'm sure other casinos do it. \n\nOut front in the lot, I saw a couple of x-game competitions, some volleyball contests one summer and for x-mas they had a skating rink that I looked forward to. They even had brooms and I joined a pick up team and we broom balled until most of us were quite bruised and battered from playing. At least we beat one of the nightclub teams. \n\nI got to discover Rehab in it's second year, before the pool became the worst biological impact to the water table since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Go if you ever want to study the cross breeding of palm trees with bronzer and axe douche spray. \n\nSome of the biggest Vegas stories I experienced happened at Hard Rock. When Stern was on terrestrial radio, I hung out with a lot of the girls and pack when they broadcast for a couple of years. I think I finally saw old footage of those shows on the tube of you. I was also on the Carson Daly show taping the same week. That was the first time I ever, uh... Hey-ooo! I was a resident by the time Artie had the not dead incident and the other one at the Rhino, ooh another review! \n\nProbably the biggest story I have was the new years I shot craps and someone joined us at the table, Dennis Rodman. It was while he was still married to Carmen (who I'll meet in another review), and before he was blacklisted from some casinos from gambling debts. I don't think he made the Black Book, though? \n\nAnd that was why I went this time. I had to see the table again, even though they moved it. I could tell, the table has an identifiable mark I memorized. \n\nWould you ever think of bringing a camera when you go out drinking at home? Or expect to have a profit more than you made at work that week? Or the excitement of seeing any number of celebrities, not just one? \n\nIt's why I moved to Vegas. It's why I draw inspiration from it. If you've ever done acid, it makes your skin feel the same, radiating heat and a frequency of color and electricity like a Tesla coil. It always ups your game to play with Champions.\n\nHard Rock is a very different animal, now. I am glad they added on and left the original parts us veterans can still hang out at. Too many casinos overhaul and force us into a whole new scheme that says adapt to new management or F you. But I got to party with HR in her earlier, wilder \"college\" days. And it was a good thing I stopped off, too. If I had gone to Twin Peaks any earlier, I would have missed out on another opportunity, the reason I hit the Strip...","useful":4}

It's served with toast, pickled onions, mustard and capers and the pate itself is in a small mason jar.  Next up, we had an order of the lamb riblettes.  I think these were the highlight for me... seriously amazing.  I'm still thinking about them several days later!  For our salad course, Jared went with the famous \"Original Chopped Salad,\" and I decided to mix it up and try the Roasted Cauliflower Caesar.  I believe both were smaller portions for the restaurant week menu, but they were still plenty big for us and we were happy with our respective choices - both fresh and tasty.  By this point, I was pretty full, but I made room for the additional side we ordered of brussels sprouts and grits.  Mmmmm!  My entree was the only thing that wasn't amazing.  I had the yellowtail and it was overcooked.  I probably would have sent it back, but I was too stuffed by this point.  Jared had the scallop entree and cleaned his plate!  Dessert offerings on the restaurant week menu were peach cornmeal cobbler and buttermilk bread pudding.

Some things are better left unchanged ;)\n\nSo... there is something to be said for a bit of old-school charm, but a little $$ to update could go a long way... Either way, you've got fans in the M family and we're sure to be back soon!","useful":11}

It is brief, but you can see the massive slot machine above the entrance if you're not fixed on the casinos like most people are.\n\nWhat I got out of Fry's is help with organization. They have filing stuff, stationary, all kinds of computer storage devices, blank cds to burn backup my drive. They have flash drives, but I'm too wary of something so small easily getting lost or \"zapped\" blank somehow. \n\nSince last fall, I've been going thru a lot of papers, filing, shredding, condensing years of crap I saved \"for later.\" Fry's has hanging folders, file boxes, shredders, even shelves and comp desks, all that stuff.\n\nThey have a lot of books, I check out the business ones. Magazines are taking a big hit, since you can get a book online for cheaper including postage. I've been reading a lot of business, marketing and advertising books lately.\n\nThey're good about marking and having rebate slips setup so you can get software for cheaper and even free. I've also been working on my photo editing skills to design some... media.\n\nThere are still dry erase boards I bought that I use to plan in each room, with a larger board for my Action Station. \n\nThere's a lot of information I have to get together in a short time, in ways I've not seen in print before. I've been picking away at it, since 1997. I get happy when I find notebooks I bough already filled out with things I forgot I already did. \n\nI love the blown up pics of old Vegas they have. I have to give props to a store that respects history that casinos won't even acknowledge with their \"new\" renovations. Some things were done better in the past. I hope it comes back because I've seen what \"new changes,\" have done. Technology was supposed to help, but clearly only a small percentage profited- obscenely.\n\nIf you get bad service or someone won't help you, remember that the store departments are based on sales commission. Why would someone who's busy making sales teach a newer employee to cut in on their action? It wasn't easy to work there, but I learned a lot and my paychecks raped the employee discount while I was there.","useful":2}

It seemed to have been hiding under my plate.  The Mister, aghast, promptly trapped the rascal under a napkin and waited for the server to come back. She returned (to bring us our to-go boxes) and he lifted the napkin to show her the offending critter. She gasped and scooped it all up and went into the back. \n\nThe Mister & I just stared at each other, incredulous. We figured this would be interesting... how would they handle it?  Would our dinner be comped? Would a manager come out, very apologetic?  \n\nSoon after, she returned and informed us that pest control had been here earlier that day (presumably this was the excuse/explanation for why the roaches were on the run). She promptly handed us our bill and advised us she'd given us 20% off, explaining she'd only done that much since we'd already eaten our dinner.\n\nSCREEEEEEEECCCCCHHH!   Wait.A.Minute.Here  So, what I'm understanding is that depending on at what point during your meal you have the bad experience, your discount will reflect that.  Good thing we didn't order dessert... if the roach had waited to show it's face until then it might have only been 5% off! \n\nI get it, restaurants can have roaches and many of them around town probably do. (Ick. I can't think about it too much or I'll end up a hermit). Regardless, it's pretty unusual for them to turn up on your table and what's critical after an incident like this is staff response which, disappointingly, was sorely lacking here.","useful":10}

We sat at the bar where Valerie was the bartender / server and gave us honest answers to all of our questions about the menu. We also made friends with Victor and Bob - the other guys sitting at the bar while we dined.

Scallop carpaccio and \"Jacob and Gabriella's favorite edamame.\"  (Jacob and Gabriella are Eddie's kids by the way).\n\nFrom there, Jared had one of their specials - short rib and prawns.  The prawns (of which I stole one to taste) were crazy big, cooked just right, and very tasty.  I went with a half order (love that they allow you to do that) of the sea bass which comes with broccolini.  It was the perfect size... and delicious.  The sea bass melted in my mouth!  I didn't even share a bite with Jared 'cause I loved it so much!  \n\nOf course, we just had to get dessert as well... and despite Valerie suggesting otherwise, we chose the apple pear cobbler a la mode.  It was good but a bit doughy.  We'll have to stick with the tiramisu or try the orange cheesecake instead next time.\n\nChef Eddie himself came out of the kitchen and socialized with us several times during our meal - i love when a chef is personable like that.

We arrived around 8:15 and Tammar and Brad were sitting outside by a fire lamp with drinks in hand.  According to Tammar, the total wait time was 36 minutes.  (They initially said it would be 30 - 40 so they were right on.)\n\nWe admired the restaurant as we followed the hostess upstairs to where we were seated.  While the tables are fairly close together, the accoustics were perfect.  I sat next to Tammar and had \"girl talk\" with the guys did their thing on the other side of the table.  \n\nFor drinks, I went with a glass of Argentinian Malbec, which I loved.   Tammar's Ketel One cocktails seemed to go down easy, Brad had a couple of different glasses of wine, and Jared went with some indie beer, one of which was Moose Drool.  Nice name!\n\nFor food, the guys split the Green Chile Stew appetizer, T had the one and only salad on the menu (hopefully they will add another option for that in the future), and I chose to start with a side of their roasted vegetables.  Unfortunately, our waiter (Rob), must've misunderstood and I was brought a soup instead.  So by the time the mistake was corrected, the rest of the table was done with their starters.

I've beaten myself up psychologically and sadly affected someone close. I apologize to her constantly, but I remain an abused mental stepchild.\n\nWhen you deal with 1) DMV, 2) hospital, 3) insurance 4) courthouse offices, you can GUARANTEE that after dragging your lazy ass out of bed, looking and dressing somewhat respectable (flush out your crotch in the case of the Doc), looking for parking, find the damn right building, right entrance, waiting for a minimum 40 minutes with Tatooine's Cantina Bar and nursery, spend weeks compiling a folder with all the shit you need, progress comes to a SCREECHING HALT when the \"person\" at the front window tells you you don't have the ONE piece of paper that blows the only available morning you have for 2 weeks to get this shit done. So we decided to get something to eat at least before my girl went to work. \n\nWell, that's a tough setup for a neutral first impression of a restaurant, but we didn't plan on that. We thought we were going to Bay City Caf√© to have a comfort meal, get our moods back up. Already frazzled on making decisions, I went against the cardinal rule in going there: sit at the counter. The lady led us to the back and I went because we haven't in a long time. BUT, I eat at the counter because there are always servers passing, plus you can see if your food is sitting in the service window and they are quicker to bring it to you when you're staring at it and them. \n\nWe stared at the cover of the menu for about 30 seconds before even opening it. Du-Par's? What. Is. Going. On? Then we notice the staff. The waitresses are dressed all 50's style, with the cool little hat (that nurses wore in the 50's?) all the busser vests had new embroidered logos. We look for deals, they have 4 Blue Plate specials. When I was little, somehow we aquired a blue plate that my mother always used to cook fried rice on or whatever for me when I was down. I had a lot of meals on this thing. I want to say it had Independence Hall on it. I remember a bell tower and a capped bicyclist. *shakes head* Anyway, I got a basic breakfast (#4), an egg, (wheat) toast, hash browns and turkey sausage links. My girl got Pancakes, egg and turkey links. \n\nLater in the menu, there's the story of the family that runs the chain in southern California. That's alright. Now I'm home, this new location isn't even on their web page yet. On the table was a Knott's jelly caddy, but with Heinz jellies. I tried to remember if Bay City had Knott's (my favorite restaurant, theme park and jelly, from SoCal) before the change. So they are open 24 hours now, but we didn't get to see that menu. I've been disappointed so many times wanting Bay City to find it closed late. We freaked from the menu I think because the old one hadn't even been around for a year, I believe. Bay City used to have $7 specials: Spaghetti and garlic bread, a huge ass bowl of stew, spaghetti and something else. That's why I originally went. Then Bush's recession all but eliminated casino specials, most notably the $3 Steak and eggs a few casinos had from 11:00PM to 6:00AM. After staycations became popular for 2009 vacation season, meal specials started popping up again, though a dollar or 2 higher. \n\nWe get breakfast, and were enjoying it. Then we looked at the pancakes, apparently what they're known for. Is that cream cheese inside? No, just really undercooked. After 4 tries to flag down out busser and neighboring server (where had ours gone?), we had them put in an order of toast to sub the cakes. In her defense our server ran around with other tables and they were still learning the new system, I suppose. But that's what soft openings are for and apparently they had been open since last Thursday, so they handled a weekend's rushes. Plus a kid nearby after us got his pancakes cooked to a good brown. Our server comes up and plops a check down and we told her about the pancakes, so I can see her make a side of toast up front. Apparently no one started it. We get the toast and to be honest, by now anyone else would have walked to the front to speak to a manager. And I am giving them more than their share of doubts because we came to calm down, not escalate my anger and ruin my girl's day, she still had to to work. Now we're worried about the dough settling in our bellies later. She took a Tums in the car, just in case. \n\nBay City WAS 5 stars with their $7 specials. They went to 4 with the revised \"recession\" menu. I'm afraid I have to Give Du-Par's 3 stars, whereas most would give it 2 if they wrote this review. Sorry, we'll try you again  some late night after the new system has been broken in more and we don't feel like walking over to Gold Spike.\n\nAnd the courthouse sits there blocks away, waiting for a confrontation after an unknown amount of days for my citation to be \"in the system.\" Bet your ASS if I got pulled over again it would be in the fuckin cop car's SCMODS","useful":4}

Success on both counts!\n\nIt was Saturday at about 6:30 and we were seated immediately. The place was almost full. We sat on the patio, which was lovely, but might get too hot during the summer (I didn't see any misters--You're Welcome, Mother Earth!). \n\n Service was attentive, and our waitress gave us several recommendations. \n\nWe ordered:\nSomosas (baked, I think, not fried, which made them a little messier to eat but still very very tasty).\nNaan (chewy, moist, naan-y...yum)\nGrilled Shrimp skewers (a little on the skimpy side, but very tasty, and served with grilled peppers and onions and a delightful mint sauce).\n\nWe each ordered individual entrees with basmati. They encourage you to order the two-entree choice, but we were trying to avoid over-ordering, and it turned out to be exactly the right amount of food. \n\nI ordered the Cauliflower and potatoes, which was moist, savory, a little spicy, and very tasty, albeit lacking a little in the sauce department (I would have liked a little something to spoon over my rice).\n\nHusband ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, which was exceptional. They claim that they don't use cream in their food, so I don't know how they made the masala sauce so creamy and good, but they did and I'm not going to question it any more! I would have licked the bowl if we had been at home. \n\nNext time I think we'll get some apps again but try the Bombay Plate to share, which is 5 entree choices and rice.

It has been renovated in recent years, and has new restaurants and clubs.\n\nMy review is based on one night that was spent in Villa One in the year 2000.  Yes, this review is 11 years old, but worth the wait.\n\nAs you may know, there are a handful of very special villas and another handful of lanais that are reserved as special accommodations for high-rollers and special guests.  They do not advertise these room types on the site, nor do they allow guests to pay for them under most circumstances.  If you have seen 'Vegas Vacation', one of the lanais were used as the high-roller suite provided to Nick Papagorgio.  The villas at the Mirage are said to have paid for the entire construction of the Bellagio!!\n\nSo, my friend wanted to throw a big party in Las Vegas, and needed a special space that could accommodate a live band, approximately 30-40 guests, and a full bar with catered food.  The event was set to take place at The Venetian, but they backed out at the last minute after learning about the live band that was set to perform in the room.  So, the race was on and it was up to me to save the day.  Apparently, I was the only one with a Black card.\n\nAs I began calling around to find a venue, I was looking out the window of our Venetian suite at The Mirage tower across the way.  Why not call them first?  They are right across the street!  So, I called.  The nice woman who answered decided to transfer me to a casino host named Matt Sacca.  Matt is very cool, and still works as a host in Vegas at Green Valley if I am not mistaken.\n\nAnyway, Matt said he could hook us up with a villa and that our party sounded fun.  After all, it was only one night.  The negotiated room rate was $10,000 plus catering, full bar with wait staff, PA system rental and setup, and miscellaneous taxes and fees.  The room rate ended up being a small portion of the total bill.\n\nI could go on and on about that night.  There is too much to write here as Yelp limits the space.  Suffice it to say, I learned a few things that night.  Some key lessons include:\n\n1.  If you want to spend all of the money you have in Las Vegas without gambling, they have made it very simple for you.  Catered food, bar service, and a private butler can easily set you back $10K+.  A PA system is about $5K a night.  I did not ask about the lion rental.\n\n2.  If skinny dipping occurs in your private pool, the butler will fish out the bathing suits and return them to you in plastic bags the next day.  Don't worry, he wears white gloves.\n\n3.  Nudity, extreme public intoxication, and Rascal scooter wheelie competitions are frowned upon in the casino.  However, the Rascal is a good instrument for earning quick cash.\n\n4.  If you want a return invitation, none of the above will help you.  Spend your money at the casino tables if you want anything comped.\n\n5.  Do something this stupid at least once in your life, given the chance.  Make your friend with the cashola really happy, and spend the airlines miles earned to take a relaxing vacation.  You will need recovery time after the Vegas madness.\n\nI will never forget that night, and that is a good thing because I just realized I completely taped over the video footage taken.  Probably a good thing!  How long is the statute of limitations in Nevada anyway?","useful":3}

I have previously steered clear of Over Easy because of all the negative reviews here, but today being Memorial Day Weekend, it was the only place that was open (we later saw that The Big Orange was open, but sorely lacking in parking spots), so we gave it a try. \n\nWe were told 10-15 minutes from the host, and I was skeptical when I saw the packed dining area, but truly we only waited about 7. So a big thumbs up for hustling us in. The patio area, which appears to hold the majority of the tables, was the best part of the experience. Shady, cool, and comfortable, and effectively shielded from the ugliness of Indian School. \n\nThen we proceeded to wait...and wait...and wait for our food. Took forever! The waitress did mention that they were down one cook. Fortunately we weren't in a hurry and hubby and I got to spend some quality together. No biggie. Our waitress forgot my mint-lemonade for about 15 minutes, and when I got it, it was simultaneously too sweet and too watery. The coffee was fair, no complaints. The water was typical Phoenix...obviously not filtered.\n\nThe food: I got the corned beef hash with two eggs sunny-side up and toast. Whoa baby, those eggs had barely touched the pan before they were spooned on to my plate! There was still a gelatinous coating of RAW floating on top of my liquid yolks, and I considered sending it back, but by then I was starving, Salmonella be damned. My corned beef hash was tasty but had several chunks of chewy gristle mixed in. Mmmmm...connective tissue....\n\nSo this place gets points for ambience, but loses stars for food quality and price.

Of course, I was looking primarily at all of the dog goodies, but if you are a cat person, they have plenty for you too!\n\nAs Minnie and I shopped around, Vince and Tony (the owners) apologized because they said they were low on inventory as it's just after the holidays.  I thought they had plenty of inventory though!  They were extremely friendly and informed me that they've owned the boutique for 6 years now!  Minnie and I missed taking pictures with 'the real' Santa Claus by just a few weeks - damn!  I also learned that they've recently been voted the 'best pet boutique in the valley' by Phoenix Magazine for the 2nd year in a row.\n\nIf you are looking to pamper your pooch, this is a great place to do it!

That was the case for me, my first time I was driven there on a night of debauch. I had no idea where we were in relation to any area of town, I couldn't even see the Strat or Luxor light. Doomed. \n\nThe biggest memories I had of Cheers occurred one year when I was in town alone for the holidays with xmas eve and day off. It sucks because of the last 4 holidays of the year, I always bargain to work Thanksgiving, xmas day and eve to score new years day off and a lunch shift if not off new years eve. \n\nOne of the rules I made for drinking on my 23rd birthday (I got alcohol poisoning on my 20-22nd b-days) was that I would drink to remember, not to forget. Well, I didn't like to have xmas off, everyone was out of town. I had patrolled the strip and saw all the Jewish, Vietnamese & other non-christians out. \n\nBars are open 24/7, well you'd be surprised how many bars start looking for their keys to doors that had remained open the other 364 nights/ year. I think I was on my 4th bar and I think I got a text to go to Cheers. This is 7+ years of accumulated blackout drunk memories, so my memory is like the reception of a portable tv. \n\nI was on my motorcycle and don't even want to know how I got there. I usually sat and ate something until I felt Monday at 9:00AM sober, paper pusher style before driving. Except for twice. And I still have the ptsd to lurch me out of sleep randomly to celebrate. \n\nWe played pool, ordered Mexican from next door & they put it in the service window when that was legal to. We had such a great time we planned it for the following year, then again... \n\nIt turned out to be one of the best Vegas xmas's I ever had. It was the wayward holiday crew, people who had no where to be because they couldn't get time from work. Or they just didn't want to be home alone. Or they strategically escaped their family with an excuse. It was us holiday left behind folk. And we were alright without the holiday stress to get everything prepared and everyone over the house, etc.\n\nThere was even a drunk Santa. Did we make out? Who did I kiss, it smelled like ash, red wine and the hopes and dreams of people stuck at the airport. \n\nI know we celebrated there the year before and a couple of years after the \"clean air\" act passed, and dining areas had to have a physical wall/ window separating the bar area. My argument was I didn' t want to sit in the dining area alone while everyone was partying. It should be my choice to bring food in where people are smoking. Whatevs, laws be cray. I voted against it and I don't even smoke. Damn window plastered up!\n\nAlways great service from the bartender, made me feel welcome and hung out and talked with us like she was happy to be there. They have the life, I loved bartending.\n\nSo I had to pay my own tribute to the wayward holiday vagabonds even though I was 5 months off. (and about 7-8 years past). I don't know what happened the first year I didn't go. I didn't want to be the guy that got too busy and left my warriors behind!\n\nAs I type this, it's Mother's Day. It's another holiday I can't really celebrate and I think of the others who can't also, because their mother passed away or some other reason.

The presentation was lovely (see pics) and the fruit quality was good but there wasn't enough hollandaise for my liking and the inclusion of two extra slices of Italian bread was confusing...I don't know what they were for; it certainly wasn't to mop up the extra liquid as it was at a premium on my plate. \n\nThey have daily dinner specials and on Mondays it's AYCE pasta - I was amused by the tagline next to it: \"You can't handle the pasta!\" - Big Papa.

My digestive tract was PISSED at me for deigning to eat seafood but every bite was worth the intestinal distress that soon followed. \n\nOh, we also got a side of mac & cheese ($5) which was ample enough for two people to share and extra creamy and cheesy.

Our drinks were delivered quickly, which I was thankful for too!\n\nI went with their wheat pancakes and a side of egg whites and my friend had the oatmeal brulee.  My eggs were a bit on the salty side, but I dealt with it, and we both enjoyed our breakfast.  The pancake serving size was huge, so I even had leftovers to bring home!  \n\nThe only awkward feedback was that my \"side of egg whites\" came on two extremely small plates instead of one medium sized one.  They also only had small to-go containers, which wasn't a big deal, but hopefully they'll order some medium sized plates and larger to-go containers in the future.\n\nOther than that, I found prices to be moderate and service spot-on.  Parking wasn't an issue and the location is super convenient to my office and the heart of Old Town, which I love!  I look forward to returning soon.  I hear their lunch menu is pretty good too!","useful":8}

I went in for an alignment. I was quoted about $99 which was fine. They did have loaner cars which was nice (although both of the ones I had over two days were given to me with the gas light already on empty. Also do note you have to pay mileage on them. The mileage charge is not very much but I'd rather they just add $5 to the cost of services and actually have the loaners be complimentary as opposed to a very cheap rental).\n\nBygones!\n\nThey called me later in the afternoon to notify me they couldn't do the requested alignment because I had a tie rod that needed to be replaced first. Dangit!  I figured I'd go get my car, have my Mr. fix-it at home fix the tie rod, then bring it back for the alignment. When I got there they told me I had to pay about $75 if I wanted to take my car.  Huh?! \n\nSeems I was getting charged for their time. They told me they'd apply the $75 to the tie rod repair, but not to the alignment. So now, even if I just take my car outta there, I'm already out $75 and I'm in the same spot I was in when I walked through the door.  I would understand charging me for the time had I walked in and said I needed a diagnosis (i.e, \"my car is making a sound, can you inspect it and tell me what's wrong?\") or even perhaps an estimate (i.e, \"I know I need a new front end, can you give me a quote?\") but I simply asked for, and expected, an alignment. I felt like they had me over a barrel at this point which was not a fun spot to be. \n\nThe end of the story - I ended up having them do the tie rod even though I didn't want to b/c I basically felt I had no other choice at that point given how much $ I already had (unexpectedly) on the counter. The tie rod got fixed & the car aligned but I won't be headed back because I don't like such unexpected charges and I've been other places around town that wouldn't have pulled that.","useful":2}

Autostrada, which means \"an expressway or highway in Italian\" serves cuisine from all around Italy.  With a capacity of less than 50 inside and another 45 outside, it's small, but the design which includes glass, steel, wood and concrete, gives this hot new restaurant a sleek, industrial vibe inside which goes with the theme very well.\n\nI had the opportunity to attend a pre-opening dinner at Autostrada last night... I believe they will be open to the public in the next few days.  I cannot be tough on the restaurant, as it was their first night open, and I was extremely impressed nonetheless.\n\nWe waited a short while to get seated, but it was a pleasure since the bartender, Erica (aka Red for her red hair) was sweet, attentive, and knowledgeable about the history of the restaurant and the menu.  They don't have their complete wine / drink menu going just yet, but I learned the majority of the wines will come from Italy, and they will also be offering a wide range of cocktails.  We enjoyed a pinot noir and cabernet while we waited.\n\nOnce seated, Shanda took care of us... For our antipasti course, I went with the cauliflower soup and J chose the caprese tower.  In addition to these starters, we quickly made friends with the couple next to us, and the next thing I know, we're sharing their cheese plate - hey, nothing wrong with that, right?  \n\nNext up, I had a tiella casserole of grilled veggies including eggplant, zucchini, parmesan cheese and a zesty tomato sauce - it was delicious! And J's fettucini with scallops and mushrooms was pretty amazing as well.  We could've stopped here, but we kept going.\n\nFor the Segundi course, I chose the sea bass and J had the veal... this is where Autostrada has a few kinks to work out, but remember, it's their first night open... I didn't love the fish - wasn't a fan of the cold veggies on the plate or the sauce which came on the fish.  The veal however, was fantastic - and I'm not usually a veal fan!  It was served on polenta - yum!  Our new friends at the table next to us chose the steak and the halibut... and again - steak was a hit while the fish dish - not so much.\n\nWe finished with the dessert that Shanda recommended, the crepes with chocolate and strawberries... omg they were scrumptious.\n\nAs you can tell, we had a lot of food... and our bill proved it coming in at around $100 before tip.  But, we had a lot of fun, made some new friends, and found several other menu items to go back for next time we're in the DC Ranch hood... plus, Autostrada will be open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner seven days a week.  \n\nWith the casual environment, friendly attentive staff, and the magical management/ownership team behind Autostrada, I'm sure they will be a success.

She teaches music video choreography and basic dance steps in a non-threatening, super fun environment and makes you feel great about yourself! The abs portion (as you can imagine looking at her abs) is deadly. Almost literally. The yoga classes are also good but there's a lot of traffic on the lower level and it can be too noisy instead of relaxing.\n- good personal trainers and packages\n\nTHE CONS:\n- the place is under constant renovations.

Actually, the fact that it's in a basement entirely is scary.\n\n- this last point isn't the gym's fault, but there's way too much socializing.

You might have to walk sideways.).\n\nOnce you've grabbed a seat, pray that Graeme is working and that he's your server, because he's the best, most laid back dude around.

It looks like 16 or so others beat me to the FTR and they've only been open for a week, so I guess there were plenty of other people excited about this new restaurant opening as well.\n\nI'm being very honest in giving a three star \"A-OK\" review, but I'm optimistic that after another visit or two, I'll be bumping it up.  The first thing I noticed is that NCounter is located in a very convenient corner location off of Mill and 3rd St (right off the light rail).  Next off, their hours: 7am - 3:05pm daily.  Interesting!  Upon walking in, I was greeted by a bunch of friendly servers...\n\nI love the fast-casual concept where you order at the counter (hence the name, I suppose) and then get your drink(s) on your own but then your food is brought to you... I was torn as I looked at the menu as there were a handful of items that sounded good to me.  My internal dialogue went something like this:\n\n\"Mmmmm... smoothies!\"\n\n\"Oh wow - they serve espresso and amazing sounding coffee drinks too - very impressive but I'll skip those today since I'm avoiding caffeine while being prego.\"\n\n\"Bloody Marys, Mimosas, Screwdrivers, Greyhounds, and more...\" I'm for sure coming back for one of those after this baby comes!\"\n\n\"OK - back to the food menu... those wheat germ granola pancakes sound like they'd be right up my alley!\"\n\n\"But maybe I should just go for an omelette?\"\n\n\"That bakery case looks pretty damn appealing too with cake pops, muffins, pastries, and more...\"\n\nAfter much of the above debating, I decided to order a fresh squeezed OJ and a Greek Omelette with egg whites and no onions.  For my side, I went with whole grain toast.  I grabbed my OJ and an iced water and found a table... and despite the restaurant being packed, our food arrived within 10 minutes.  \n\nHere's where my constructive criticism comes in for NCounter: \n-A couple of onions got thrown in there, but that's forgiveable.  \n-I suggest toasting the bread a bit more if you're going to call it toast; mine was not toasted!\n-The verbiage that is listed with the Omelettes on the menu says \"with your choice of toast, potatoes, fruit, cottage cheese or tomatoes.\"  So I assumed my omelette would come with my choice of one of those things.  It actually came with potatoes as well as the toast I asked for, which was a bonus, but I would've prefered to order toast and fruit or toast and cottage cheese!\n-The artichokes on the omelette were cold but the rest of the omelette was hot - just kind of a weird combo with each bite.\n\nAside from the above complaints, my food was good and considering they've only been open a week, I had a very positive first experience here.  Overall, this place is awesome and a welcome addition to the hood!  I can't wait to go back soon and try those pancakes... or perhaps a smoothie?!","useful":8}

Since I'm unable to, whenever I bug my coworkers to go there I simply make up a new name for it.  For example:\n\n\"hey guys, we should go to old Mcdonalds house of Brass Railroad Tracks.\"\n\nor\n\n\"Hey, lets go to Brass Traintrack Rails at noon.\"\n\nSince most of my coworkers have not been afflicted with heavy drinking habits and/or retardation they know what I'm talking about.\n\nI sought this place out as a lunch time place during work hours since often I crave a simple beer for lunch instead of caloric \"food.\"  Usually my fellow workers and I will end up at the Dirty Drummer, since it's right across the street from our office building.  This was fine for a while until I realized that The Dirty Drummer is actually fucking gross, the atmosphere is depressing and the servers are visually annoying.  Thanks to my obsession with Yelp and alcohol, I was able to find this little gem, a simple and tasty dive bar that is literally four minutes from our office.  \n\nOld Brass Rail is large and not at all intrusive, it's not so local that everyone looks at you when you walk in and it's not so detached that they don't care that you're there.  Plus, they have those high top bar tables that are fun to sit at, especially when they're spread out and you don't have to hear other people's conversations.  They have a million flat screen TV's for when the conversation slows or when you dine with boys who are distracted by lights and moving objects around them.\n\nI've only been there twice, both times we had the same server, both times all my comrads ordered the amazingly reasonable and genius idea of a three dollar breakfast until 2 p.m.  Everyone loves breakfast, and to serve a cheap breakfast at a BAR until 2 p.m. is god damn fucking brilliant.  The server was super nice, sweet and friendly, remembered us, offered suggestions, was not put off by the fact that we are an unlikely group to be at bar in the middle of a weekday.  I can honestly say that both times I thoroughly enjoyed my Old Brass Railroad Tracks experience. \n\nI didn't order breakfast because I am not a \"breakfast food\" person.  I order lunch, even in the morning.  I ordered the chicken strips and a salad, I've also had the fries.  Everything was what you expect as far as bar food but genuinely not gross, with the added bonus that it was NOT, in fact, The Dirty Drummer.  Also, it's not over priced for what it is, 7 for an app, 7 for a burger, cheap beers, good specials, 4.50 pitchers, such a great find.  Also, 3.50 breakfast AT A BAR- GENIUS.  In addition to the totally acceptable food, pleasant service and good prices, you get the added bonus of checking out an old school cigarette vending machine on your way out.  I hope to return to Train Tracks of Brass Railroad Bar soon.","useful":5}

It was impressive... so how could we resist heading back??\n\nRound two was great.  A lively, modern space, DLUX impresses when it comes to ambiance.  The place has had a wee bit of a wait on both of the weeknights we've been there, which is not surprising given that the place is not as big as it appears from the outside.  Love the decor and lighting, it pulses with urban energy.  Purse hooks tucked under the bar are always a nice touch, as is validated parking at one of the nearby ramps (be sure to refer to the website to make sure you park in the right one!) The large 4-sided bar is the centerpiece of the restaurant, literally, and semi-circle booths and small rectangular tables line three of the walls, leaving a small front area open for a happy hour crowd standing and mingling.  Patio tables out front offer an urban dining experience, which I definitely enjoy.  We had Lola B. Dog with us and the DLUX staff graciously accommodated her on the patio, even offering water. \n\nThe menu is primarily burgers, with a few salads (all of which included meat, although you can ask for it without and they'll also knock $2 off the price if you do that, so that's appreciated) Plenty of vegetarian options with the burgers, as they allow a free substitution to a portabella on any of their tasty concoctions. There is also a Portabella Caprese burger on the menu along with a White Bean burger, which was excellent.  We also tried the special of the day, which was a falafal burger - it was quite good, but be warned, on the spicy side!  The size of the burgers were good for me, but probably a tad small for a strapping lad who may want to opt for the upgrade to a double (+$3). No sides come with these burgers (all $8) so if you want fries with that plan on +$2.  I'm fine with that, I don't need/want a pound of fries with my dinner anyways!\n\nService was good on our recent visit and the hostess was charming, even double-checking with her manager that we could have the dog on the patio (which we could as long as she didn't get under foot, of course).

It is tucked away in the back of the property, providing quick access to the freeway or the Strip.\n\nOnce inside, the style of the property is very modern and sleek.  While we were waiting to get checked-in, we were looking at the massive piece of art behind the front desk.  It took a while to figure it out, but there is a hidden theme that you need to uncover.\n\nThe suites are very modern and comfortable.  With a small living room, powder bath, and large master bedroom and bathroom, there is more than enough space for two people to be very comfortable.  Flat screen televisions and all of the amenities you would expect are included.  The room service was delivered quickly and was good.\n\nThe only real negative, in my opinion, is being at the furthest end of the Strip.  If you like to wander around on foot and explore the entire time, this is not an ideal location.  If you don't mind using taxis or limos, you are sure to be pleased with the bang for the buck that you receive at this hotel.","useful":1}

The large 4-sided bar is the centerpiece of the restaurant, literally. Semi-circle booths and small rectangular tables line three of the walls, leaving a small front area open for a happy hour crowd standing and mingling. \n\nDLUX was running a 15min wait at 7pm on a Tuesday, not surprising given how few tables there actually are when it gets down to it; the place is not as big as it appears from the outside.  I liked the decor and lighting, it pulses with urban energy.  Purse hooks tucked under the bar are always a nice touch, as is validated parking at one of the nearby ramps (be sure to refer to the website to make sure you park in the right one!)  \n\nThe menu is primarily burgers, with a few salads (all of which included meat, although I'm sure you could ask for it without, but then you're paying for protein you're not getting, but I digress...) Plenty of vegetarian options with the burgers, as they allow a free substitution to a portabella on any of their tasty concoctions. There is also a Portabella Caprese burger on the menu along with a White Bean burger, which was excellent.  The size of the burger was good for me, but probably a tad small for a strapping lad who may want to opt for the upgrade to a double (+$3). No sides come with these burgers (all $8) so if you want fries with that plan on +$2.  I'm fine with that, I don't need/want a pound of fries with my dinner anyways!\n\nThe burgers and ambiance were a solid 4*, it was the service that was a bummer.  I was surprised, given the very friendly and cheerful host staff and all the positive accolades on the service listed here.  Hopefully our experience was just a fluke.\n\nThe trouble began when we ordered an appetizer to start (spinach dip) and then burgers & beer.  The beers came... then the burgers... THEN the appetizer (Marissa's pet peeve #92 - they call it a \"starter\" for a reason, folks, if it was supposed to come after you got your dinner it would be called \"dessert\").  \n\nNow, I understand that kitchen crews sometimes make things out of order or a server puts in a whole order at once instead of staggering their entries... BUT this is server 101 - when poor timing happens you either:\na) correct it with the kitchen staff before it even gets to the table or \nb) apologize to the table for things being out of order and figure out a way to remedy it.  \n\nEither of these can help negate pet peeve #92.  However, when neither of those things happen and the server brings the burgers and then returns with the appetizer, without a word of acknowledgement that things are out of order or an apology, well, I'd like to introduce you to Marissa's pet peeve #107.  Either:\n a) the server will hope I don't notice that my \"starter\" just became my \"ender\" or \nb) she doesn't care or \nc) she doesn't know any better.  \n\nHmm.  I've got a problem with any of those options. All that being said, I liked the energy and ambiance of the place and my burger was good.  I'd give DLUX another shot but I know whose section I'd avoid.  Wink wink.","useful":2}

We had a party of four and showed up for a later dinner (9:00ish) on a Wednesday night.  The restaurant was quiet but I instantly liked the ambiance and modern feel... The hostesses that greeted us were not the most welcoming, or perhaps they were confused since we asked if we could sit at a table that was vacant but hadn't been cleaned yet instead of sit elsewhere.  Once the seating situation was settled, the staff was friendly-ish, but the service itself was on the (very) slow side.\n\nWe were all pretty hungry, so we ordered some apps for the table to start with: Bachi Pickles, Edamame, and Truffle Parm Fries.  The pickled plate isn't ideal for sharing, but the others made  up for it and our party demolished both.  For my entree, I went for the Bachi Fish sandwich and added shishito pepper.  I happen to love shishito pepper, but when I've had it at Asian / International inspired places before, it's cooked. The shishito pepper on my sandwich was not - oh well.  Lesson learned: I like shishito pepper best when it's cooked!  The fish itself was cooked to perfection and of course the fluffy bun it was served on complimented it well.  It was fluffy and sweet.\n\nThe others at the table had a Mr Miyagi burger, a Spicy Miso burger, and a Lonely Bird.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their respective orders.  Most of us had iced matcha green tea to drink...\n\nFrom what I hear, this location is fairly new, so they likely just have to work through some kinks with the service.  I'd definitely be open to returning in the future once that happens.  If you're craving a simple burger, or even something a bit more creative, you can't go wrong with the food at Bachi Burger.","useful":7}

This suits my palate really well -- I love novelty chocolates, but at the end of the day, my fave ones are anything nutty with at least 70% dark chocolate... and Soma has this in spades so two thumbs up immediately!\n\nI also love this location in the Distillery district. It's got a cafe so you can enjoy your purchase with some coffee or hot chocolate while you watch how they make their chocolates from their clear window with a view of their \"laboratory\".\n\nNow on to the chocolates...\n\nPop Rocks Gianduja\n- This is my favorite -- dark choco hazelnut ganache mixed with pop rocks and wrapped in dark choco shell\n- crispy and crunchy, then creamy and nutty, then bittersweet... Love love love!\n\nPistachio Crisp\n- Pistachio crunch in a milk choco shell -- love at first bite\n- The crispy nutty poppy center topped with Sicilian pistachio made me forget that this was milk instead of dark chocolate.\n- This is orgasm in a chocolate shell. Seriously. It's that good.\n\nCaramel Feuilletine\n- Chewy fleur de sel caramel wrapped in milk choco, then rolled in choco and almond slivers\n- Other than the caramel sticking in your teeth, I liked this.\n\nPeruvian Dark Chocolate Almond Clusters \n- this is a bag of clustered almonds covered in dark Peruvian chocolate, than sprinkled with handmade toffee\n- i love the outright nuttiness, then the jolt of crunchy toffee, matched with the bitter chocolate \n- must get all the time!\n\nFleur de sel caramel\n- gooey salted caramel goodness wrapped in dark chocolate, topped with sea salt crystals\n- This is good, but was edged out slightly by Stubbe's fleur de sel bonbon\n\nBalsamic vinegar\n- interestingly good -- one of their novelty pieces that I liked. \n- creamy dark choco ganache blended with a bit of tangy balsamic, then dipped in dark chocolate\n\nOlive oil\n- It comes in a conical shape wrapped in foil. Subtle and quite good. \n- The chocolate flavor is heightened by the olive oil blend; let the chocolate roll on the roof of your mouth and you'll really taste the olive oil\n\nCaramel kiss truffle\n- slightly on the sweeter side, but there's something about it that makes me forgive the extra sugar... \n- I also 'accidentally' put some sea salt crystals. And voila, yum!\n\nEspresso crunch\n- starts out quite bitter and strong, then has a creamy, almost cheese-y after taste\n- this is a bold piece -- if you like bold black coffee, this is for you.\n\nDouglas fir\n- Wow -- tastes like grass. Definitely creative, but I didn't like it. \n- My hubby liked it though, so maybe it just didn't suit my taste.\n\nGianduja milk chocolate\n- The hazelnut is finely ground to blend in with the milk chocolate ganache. \n- It's good, but there are so many other pieces to choose from that this takes a back seat.\n\nBergamot\n- another novelty piece that I liked. It has just the right blend of tea and ganache.\n\nLemon and australian ginger\n- creamy dark choco ganache is the perfect contrast for the ginger and lemon herb taste that is both sweet and tangy at same time.\n\nChai spice\n- Slightly spicy! Good with the marzipan\n\nSpicy Mayan dome\n- Talk about bold, this is your piece if you like it spicy!\n- It's quite innovative, but a little much for my choco taste\n\nPineapple\n- fruity, creamy, liquid caramel wrapped in dark chocolate to balance the sweetness\n- a little too sweet for me though\n\nPopcorn\n- Milk chocolate ganache with a dark chocolate shell and a salted candied popcorn piece on top\n- a new piece that isn't the booklet yet, but I must have this again!\n\nMadagascar\n- One of my fave varietals. No nonsense -- just plain good!\n\nJava 70% criollo cacao\n- light and smokey, exotic and fruity! very good chocolate with berry notes ,\n- lots of character -- everything u would expect from a criollo! My new fave single origin piece!\n\nIf I still lived in Toronto, I would probably be here every week! Unfortunately, I'll have to wait for my next annual visit or bug people who visit occasionally to bring me some Soma love whenever they come to town. Aaaahh chocolate heaven in T.O.!","useful":2}

But given the type of \"walk in\" clientele they're likely forced to endure, I can't say I blame them. \n\nHaving said that, I've had excellent experiences here, both firsthand and as a 'handholder' and witness to my friend's piercings and tattoos.\n\nPIERCINGS:\n* I always have my piercings done by Amber. She's done various cartilage (ear) piercings for me and they were all professionally pierced, healed well and didn't give me any trouble. Amber takes the time to talk you through the piercing process (none of the piercers skip any of the important details - you can tell they follow the rules and it's a good thing!) and is a perfectionist when it comes to aligning your piercing and making sure it'll turn out right. It's basically a no nonsense operation.\n* I also tagged along for a friend's first time ear piercing (like, the standard ear piercing) and while she was a bit freaked out, she handled it like a champ and there was no better person to do the piercing than Amber.\n* Finally, I was unfortunately forced to tag along for my (male) friend's genital piercing and while I can't say it was an enjoyable experience to begin with, the guy who did the piercing was quite terse almost to the point of being annoyed. I can't really say I blame him as this friend is particularly annoying as well. \n\nTATTOOS:\n* Don't bother trying to make an appointment over the phone, even if you know exactly what you want, where you want it and have an idea of how much you want to spend. They absolutely will not book your tattoo appointment over the phone - you have to go in and show them what you want. Sometimes the tattoo artists are there and can quickly take a look and give you an estimate, if not they'll make an appointment for you.\n* I had a small tattoo done by Stuart and he's a truly \"no nonsense\" guy. No small talk or chit-chat, and you almost get the idea that he doesn't like you while he's working on you. But really I think that's just his personality. My tattoo faded quite a bit within a few months and Stuart retouched it for free (as per the boutique's policy of one year) without any trouble. I would not recommend him for a first time tattoo as it might scare you off getting another one. \n* A friend of mine had his first tattoo done by India and she was super easygoing and sympathetic. I sat with him in the tattoo space and she talked to us both while she prepped him and basically set him at complete ease. I would highly recommend going to her for a first time tattoo as she has the friendliest disposition of all the artists at New Tribe, from what I've seen!","useful":23}

But this isn't what brought me here - it was the lure of 17 types of sandwiches on freshly baked bread, 7 of them vegetarian. I've been longing for a strictly sandwich place to open up to tear down Sandwich Box's reign as king of the roost for years now. Ike's Place in San Francisco, which offers 100+ sandwiches and boasts two hour lineups down the block (1888 reviews and counting: http://www.yelp.com/biz/ikes-place-san-francisco) comes to mind. \n\nI was a loyal Wilco fan for the first four albums straight - but when A Ghost Is Born dropped in 2004 I was no longer interested, and I've certainly never listened to Sky Blue Sky or Wilco ST. But I have always felt a sort of kinship with Jeff Tweedy as a fellow migraineur and fiery soul. If you've never listened to Wilco and want to, may I highly recommend Summerteeth (1999) and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (2002). The former is where my sandwich of choice \"She's A Jar\" (almond butter spread on slices of honey-nut whole wheat bread, topped with slices of banana and sprinkled with cinnamon for $4.29) got its inspiration. It's a great song and a bangin' 1-14 sold album of tracks. Acquire it.\n\nSandwich was tasty but a thick layer of almond butter is tough to eat and I don't recommend it when meeting up with an old friend to catch up. You'll struggle to spit out more than a few words at a time between peeling almond butter from the roof of your mouth. I shall choose another veggie sandwich next time. The tomato & rice soup with parmesan was beyond excellent.

For that reason alone, I've been wanting to try this Steakhouse.  The menu is created by Michelin starred Chef, Jean-Georges Vongerichten.  The restaurant resides atop the high end Phoenician Resort.  And I've heard many a good review about this place.  Unfortunately, my expectations were too high; my experience at J & G was mediocre.\n\nOur team of servers led by Justis was not the problem, the service was fine.  And the drinks were decent too... I especially was happy with my extra dirty Goose martini - it was as big as my head and went down smooth.  But the food was not worth the money!  \n\nThe rolls they serve don't compare to the popovers at BLT or the bread basket at Mastro's.  The Caesar salad didn't have much flavor.  The Rib eye  steak, while a nice portion, was dry and lacked typical rib eye flavor.  The Chilean Sea Bass was just ok... and I typically love sea bass, especially when it's prepared with a miso-yuzu broth, but I've had better.  And while I didn't try the sweet and sour pork belly, the guys at our table left half of it uneaten.  That's gotta say something.\n\nOn the other hand, our party of five enjoyed the oyster appetizer and the family style sides (roasted mushrooms, steamed broccoli, and creamed spinach).  We also enjoyed the ambiance, the beautiful view, and the desserts.  My favorite was the carrot cake but we also tried an apple tart and the chocolate lava cake.\n\nBottom line - it really comes down to the food... If you're looking for an incredible steak house, there are a handful of others I'd recommend before J & G.","useful":14}

Additionally, since we were seated in the middle of the sushi bar, all of the wait staff would reach over us to pick up the sushi for their tables, which was very distracting while we were eating!  Perhaps they could've moved the sushi ready for pick-up to the side of the sushi bar to avoid distracting guests in the future?\n\n-The sushi itself was good; not amazing.  We had a Sunset roll, a Lotus roll, a Large roll, and an order of Ikura.  I didn't realize the Lotus roll was going to have a ton of mayo along with the baked Lobster that came on top of it... it was a bit on the creamy side for my liking.\n\n-To top things off, when the bill came, they overcharged us... a simple mistake, but given our experience, it was just one more negative thing... and then when I pointed it out, I barely got an apology at all.\n\nWith so many other restaurants to choose from in the Tempe Marketplace, I am not sure I'll return to Kabuki.

I took note of her authentic fuschia thai outfit and was pleased with the fact that she followed me over to clean the table thoroughly before I sat down.

I assumed from this that Sala had hosted some kind of dinner for elementary students and their families; very cool.\n\nThe menu is extensive and I had a hard time deciding what to order... everything looked really good!  There were several items that I had never seen on a thai menu before such as several entrees with pumpkin and a thai omelet.  That is the problem with dining solo at a thai restaurant - you don't get to share and try different dishes.  I enjoyed looking at the menu and the pictures of select dishes as well.  Please note - Sala Thai does not serve alcohol.  They do offer fresh fruit thai mocktails and thai iced coffee and tea.  \n\nAfter much debate, I went with #10 to start - Thai Salad with Peanut Sauce and #84 - Spicy Eggplant with Shrimp.  I was really happy with the salad; It tasted fresh and included lettuce, tomato, cucumber, carrots, onions, and red peppers.  The peanut Sauce was served on the side and it was sweet, creamy, and the perfect sauce to compliment the salad.  I ordered the Eggplant with 'medium' spice.  This was plenty!  I tend to like spice, but next time I may even order mild-medium.  I was happy they served me plenty of white rice to balance the spice of the dish...\n\nServing sizes were generous and I had leftovers to take home.

She's always punctual, sends email or phone call reminders and is as gentle or forceful as you ask her to be. If you are new to massage therapy and intimidated by having a stranger touch you, I can't recommend her highly enough as the person to see. There's nothing scary or embarrassing here, and she's trained in many types of massage so there's surely something to suit your needs, whether it's a post-marathon rubdown, working out a strange and sudden kink in your neck or general spa-like bliss.\n\nSophi's touch is magical and I dare you to not fall asleep during one of her thigh-quiveringly delightful massages.

That's how relaxing our time together is.\n\nI suffer from chronic migraines as well as being a stomach sleeper (a terrible thing) and I can't tell you how beneficial massage therapy has been in curbing my migraines and soothing my neck tension.\n\nIf you have benefits through your employer and aren't taking advantage of the massage portion, you should be ashamed of yourself! Sophi provides massage receipts and can easily invoice you by PayPal if that's convenient for you.

And then I looked to my right and realized that birthday girl's grilled cheese didn't come at all.  We all sat there while our food got cold for a good 20 minutes.  (I'm not exaggerating).  The waitress said it was coming right out, but it didn't.  About 25 minutes later, she brought out an order of French Toast.  (Not what birthday girl had ordered).  My husband said to keep the French Toast at the table for everyone to share -- and we ended up paying for that too.  It was another 10 minutes before the grilled cheese arrived, and without even an \"I'm sorry for the delay\" from the manager that delivered it. \n\nI had to leave to take one of my kids home, but I left feeling like we wasted our money at this brunch... and that was before I learned that we were double charged for the sides of fries and berries.  The bill showed two sides of each when we only ordered one.

So while I'm giving a less than stellar review here, I will mutter under my breath and keep seeing Dr. Jarvis, as I have been for the last 20 years. Dermatology is one field where seniority and patient loyalty have no bearing on the service that you receive... \n\nI'm pretty sure Dr. Jarvis only works at this office 1-2 days per week and also takes a lot of vacation, so that may count for an explanation as to why it's so hard to get an appointment.\n\nThe receptionist is beyond rude. One of the most sour and generally unfriendly greetings I've ever had the displeasure of encountering. I'm pretty sure she's been working at that office for a century. One of those \"I hate my job but hey, it's been 20 years and I'm not exactly qualified to make a move to go elsewhere\" types. What can you do except write a Yelp review about it warning future patients not to expect a warm welcome? \n\nMore warnings:\n* You will never, ever be seen on time. The closest to my actual appointment time I've been seen is one hour late. The longest was three hours. \n\n* They don't \"do\" appointment reminders. So either start using an electronic calendar or get someone who uses one to remind you about that January 19, 2012 appointment. \n\n* After your appointment you'll stupidly ask the receptionist if you can book your next year's followup appointment (as you do, in vain, every year) and she'll say \"my calendar doesn't go that far\" and tell you to call closer to the date. So you'll set yourself a reminder to call six months later, and then the line will be busy for weeks on end (I've used *66 for this and forgotten about it, then gotten a call two weeks later. TWO WEEKS.) and when she finally answers, will put you on hold and may or may not come back to you.\n\n* Everyone in the waiting room is old and looks depressed (because they've been waiting hours and might ACTUALLY die before being seen). Seriously, if any filmmakers want inspiration for what it must have been like to grow up in war-torn Bulgaria or toiling away in a Russian gulag, go check out the waiting room at 2917 Bloor Street West.","useful":50}

That's a long time. And the Etobicoke store is one of the largest in North America - something like 25,000 square feet. Or metres. One of those two. \n\nAs an IKEA expert, here are some tips from me to you to ensure a peaceful trip to IKEA that doesn't end with weeping or divorce proceedings:\n\n1) Come with a list of things you're looking for but be prepared for NOTHING to be in stock. This is a hallmark of IKEA product and the reason my parents stopped shopping here in the early 1980s. When the clerk looks up the item, peer over their shoulder and take note whether the item has a \"K\" (catalogue item) or an \"O\" (optional item). If it's the latter and there is no stock, YOU WILL NEVER SEE THIS ITEM AGAIN. Forget about it and move on.\n\n2) Stick together. DO NOT SEPARATE FROM YOUR SHOPPING PARTNER. There is next to no cell phone reception in IKEA, probably for the same reason there are no clocks or windows in Vegas or at Christian weekend retreats. If you're shopping with a girl, you'll inevitably lose her in the textiles department, so don't rely on texting or calling her to get her 10-20. Just stay with her and endure the idle browsing and nattering.\n\n3) If you know exactly what you want and it's not in stock at the store, order online or via the 1-800 number to save hassles. The stock comes from a warehouse in Quebec and there's a flat fee for delivery so just because something's not in stock at the store doesn't mean it's out of reach (unless, of course, it's one of those aforementioned \"O\" items).\n\n4) Don't be vague when asking about things you've seen in the catalogue. How would you like it if every other question you heard was \"Do you have this shelf, it's sort of white, maybe wicker, but also maybe melamine, and it's about this big?\" or \"Do you have these drapes that look like denim and have pockets? Oh, and I saw them here like five years ago. Any ideas?\" or \"Do you have that thingamabob that I saw on a night table on page 82 of the catalogue?\"\n\n5) STAY AWAY FROM THE MEATBALLS. Trust.\n\n6) You have to build everything yourself. Some furniture comes in multiple boxes so make sure you have everything. When you get home, read through all the instructions and sort your hardware, put something protective on the ground and think before you turn that Allen Key - it is supremely frustrating to go ahead and start screwing things in only to realize you're doing it upside down or on the 'unfinished' side. Only some instructions recommend the help of another person but to be honest, you could always use someone's help so call someone. A drill/electric screwdriver is your best pal here. There are also people that you can pay to do this -- ask at customer service. For some of the ridiculous items (like anything in the PAX wardrobe series), it's very worth it and will save you a possible brain aneurysm and/or your marriage. Also stay away from the ANEBODA series, because it will ruin your life.\n\n7) If you're getting stuff delivered, make sure you triple check everything before the delivery dudes leave - open boxes, inspect that nothing's missing or damaged, and sign the release form. Don't sign it until you've checked everything, because it is a huge hassle to get the delivery people back to your place to do pickups and exchanges.\n\n8) Befriend people that work at IKEA. Better yet, get a part-time job there. The discounts are fierce and you NEED to be at the seasonal employee \"As Is\" sales where boxes that have the teeniest bit of damage are flying off shelves at 50-75% off. You can easily get invited to one of these as someone's guest. Seriously - I have furnished entire apartments with finds from these sales. At one point I had extra headboards in storage, that's how good of a deal I got on my beloved OSLO bed.\n\n9) The store is open till 9pm weeknights (used to be 10pm) and I would highly recommend going at those times. Even if you show up at 8:55pm no one is going to kick you out right away because the cashiers have to work till 10 and finish cashing people out. So get your shit and go. Whatever you do, do NOT go on a weekend no matter how good the sales look, because you'll want to hang yourself, along with the other 10,000 people that visited the store that day.\n\n10) In addition to emptying your bank account, you can also stuff your gullet and pickle your liver at IKEA. They have dirt cheap breakfast (scrambled eggs, sausages, and home fries for $1) and even beer (pints of Carlsberg for $3.75).","useful":11}

The facility is also not the cleanest and it doesn't have the bells and whistles you may find at bigger, newer trampoline parks in town.  \n\nI recently jumped with my daughter and we did a couple of the foam pit areas.

It's stressful, not just what the news is, but how people react to it with violence directed at each other instead of where angry energy should be: in replacing law makers and judges.\n\nSo this made me think of the last time I went to Bellagio. I have always walked past the fountains with whatever mission, I think maybe I have seen a full show twice. I exited the casino from the front entrance and for the first time I went along the lake walkway instead of that infernal moving walkway to the right. \n\nIt was the weekend and it was perfect, the sun was setting over the building and the sunlight made its dark orangy sherbert colored horizontal wipe disappear up the casino faces across the street on the east side. For some reason people pack into tight areas without seeing there's a big empty space 20' away, so I went there and splayed my elbows out on the railing, like Linus and Charlie Brown do when they shoot the shi7 and ponder. I always wondered what they were looking at. Starting from the right, this is what I saw:\n\nThe walkway. I have flashbacks because 2 of my broughams and I were making our way to Light one night (my embarrassing spiked hair, shiny shirt days) when we saw something huge fall down from the parking structure. People gathered around and we heard screaming. I didn't even look, we just took off to tell the bell captain. I always get skittish if I have to use that walkway and NEVER look towards the parking wall.\n\nTo the left, the intersection of Bell's valet. I spent a new years at this intersection, cops were patrolling single file in actual riot gear waiting for pandemonium. Drunk people goosestepped in formation behind them. This was a year that some guy climbed the light post, I know real specific. I think this guy made the news though after falling, right before fireworks. My date, wonder what... she's doin' now....\n\nIn the middle lane southbound in front of Paris. A friend was visiting, we used to be on call for mechanic work together. And in true poetic justice we both witness a drunk guy run across the street and actually get hit by and bounce off of the front of a minivan. Screw the beer we had, we lept into responder mode as I steered traffic away- people gunning it from waiting for that Flamingo light for so long. I almost got hit, too while my bro Jay dealt with the driver and hit tourist. Hundreds of people walking by and the ambulance guy said only one person called 911... Me. Humanity! Ponderous!\n\nBarbary Coast. I never called it the replacement \"B\" word and weeks after my fountain show, they'd shut it down to make a more unpronounceable named \"boutique\" casino. Boutique in Strip-ese means add $75 more/ night over the rack rate nearby. It's where we saw Fat Elvis (self-proclaimed) before he was relocated. And gone the Victorian Room?! And Drai's before Vic branched to L.A. I will always ALWAYS remember Barbary as where the Dirty Dozen bachelorette party incident took place. \n\nAgain left, Olives' balcony, the restaurant across the way from where I watched the fountain show last. That night I led 2 women dressed to the nines past upset waiting people and talked a server into crashing a table (with a couple!) long enough for the show. Tipped the server a $20 for 15 minutes, worth it. And a great night was had, quite.\n\nAbove it, across the street at Caesars. There's a window I used to look out over there in one of my quiet hidden spots where I got caught up on work away from the loud chaotic office I was provided to \"work\" in. \n\nVegas is amazing when you can be there long enough have a memory every 60' or so. \n\nLooking back, somehow I handled those days. I have to find a way to handle today the same way, be more positive and stay away from gatherings- mobs when the news gets bad.","useful":0}

Even Maxim and Man Show were gaining popularity long before arrested development and man child became clich√©s. It was a time for men to reclaim their honor from being schlubby guys.\n\nThere are at least a dozen women I remember off the bat. Man, where do I write about each of them? And I always had the same drink order, so I know a couple of bartenders would remember me, they were just happy to mix a drink that wasn't in the top 10 everyone orders, but not so damn obscure. Yeah, I bartended.\n\nI went out with my first stripper/ entertainer/ dancer from there. Yeah, yeah, eew. I had my early 20's of experience in what we called \"Nights of Sin\" in San Francisco strip clubs, so I was... selective? She was in college and had an out plan. Not only that, she didn't do drugs, yeah yeah. But she also didn't liquor up to numb the pain of having to deal with the guys, either. We went to the closest place for breakfast after her shift, which unfortunately was a Denny's. It's now a cloverleaf exit from the 15 to Sahara east. And subsequent times out confirmed enough to me everything you thought was bs a few sentences ago. She did run her own business after college and then switched to another new career after she got married.\n\nCH got a lot of things right, the music wasn't blaring all the time and there were bars on both sides of the main floor. When they expanded to the other room, the dynamic got a little iffy as people were always congesting the artery, wondering what was goin on on the other side. At least they didn't make it a VIP or some other type of upgrade room, that would make the main floor barren with cheap asses.\n\nOne of the best nights I had there was the night of a big summer dust storm and the fire department was called in. Fireman+ strippers, it was the most hilarious awesome classic hour I've ever spent in that building, even more than seeing Nick Cage there. Even more than investigating a particular folklore I heard about him. \n\nI missed the Jenna days, she was in porn by then and after the Millenium, I wised up financially and paid off all my credit cards. I visited occasionally just for a drink and to sit at the bar. The girls I knew knew I was a server, so we complained about cheap customers to each other, albeit their decimal was a bump to the left of my job. Come to think of it, when I was considering moving, a couple of the girls hooked me up with people in restaurants to talk to?! I have a collection of CH bar naps back when they allowed the girls to write on them. They stopped that to prevent post shift shenanigans, before cell phone rules and when texting became a thing. \n\nStrip clubs have changed from what I have heard & read. Guys drink energy drinks, djs blast house music instead of rock classics. The Vip is bigger and I learned my lesson, even though it took me 2 visits (to be sure). Maybe the new place will have a cigar trubador, or even give us a nice surprise with a kitchen. \n\nI'll eventually check out the new place, I just wanted to review the good things they did and hope that isn't changed.

Since my g/f had the night off- the timeliest new statistic for unemployment- she was able to spend a lot of time with me before I had to leave. And to think we kept worrying she'd have to work thru my last request visits.\n\nTiffany's is actually located inside White Cross drug store. People say it's a sketchy part of the neighborhood. At least people that get custard recommendations from Craig Ferguson. (Luv It's is diagonal across the street behind the AM/PM.) There's always security walking around inside. Tiffany's used to be Liberty diner. And White Cross Drugs has been around so long, in the 50's and 60's it was known as a hangout for celebrities and showgirls after their shows. There were more businesses in the area and the residences were pretty high end back then. The Good Neighbor Pharmacy was even a bigger chain, as big as Woolworth's. I first discovered this place (and the newly opened Art Bar) when I used to live down Oakey and took this path to get to Industrial to get to the back Forum shops parking. \n\nSomehow, we weren't even going to go here, as it was daylight out. We usually have late night eats here, most likely on the way home from somewhere near Fremont Street. We tried Battista's for my last dinner, but we got there at an early 4:00PM and they weren't even open. We decided there was no better place to go than Breakfast at Tiffany's, mostly known as Tiffany's. I've often called it Louie's, for the chef who's there just about every night we've ever went. Everyone who's been there knows who I'm talking about. Well we were too early to see him, too. So I believe it was only the second time I had a chef that wasn't Louie. \n\nThey have a pretty decent sized menu, breakfast 24 hours. They have nightly dinner specials listed on their chalkboard. Ask for a to go/ delivery menu, it has all the specials written on it for each night. Pictures of Tiffany's pops up quite a bit in the most of the free publications in town. At least I always recognize it when someone does a story on service, dining out, etc. They filmed a movie here too that escapes my mind, with Drew Barrymore? Never saw the movie. They have pictures of it posted up for it over the soda fountain area. You pass by a cake/ pie cooler when you walk in. We decided to go back later that night for pie, since I actually made something.\n\nThe food is always filling, there are always generous portions that seem to overflow the oval plates no matter what we get. My favorites are spaghetti, the Manhattan burger (I pay extra to add mushrooms). They have a mushroom burger, but not on sourdough. Omelets are always filling, but I can never finish the potatoes. The spaghetti is huge, I always get that knowing I want half for breakfast the next day. I've had over 2/3 the menu.  \n\nI've had so many great times at Tiffany's. I've gone after First Fridays, which is where I must have the most drinking stories from. I've had many meals with my g/f there. They just started posting up pics of people eating there. I'm there, tough to say where. One of the paintings even has their own group I'm a member of on facebook. It's a river like scene and in the middle of it, for some unknown reason is Clint Eastwood from Josey Wales. I brought so many friends here, they have to pass some sort of initiation to be brought here. It's like a secret fishing spot, but eventually you want everyone you know to come. \n\nWe went later that night after walking around Fremont street one more time, taking tons of pictures. We had coffee, pie and cake. We had another friend with us. We took a lot of pictures. I presented Louie with a framed picture for the restaurant that I hope he put up on the menu wall. He was a little surprised, I don't know if he took it home? Let me know if you see it. You'll know. It has a lot of meaning from there.\n\nI've had many deep conversations dining here, with a lot of my closest friends. I've been here drunk as hell to recover. Most everyone who's been to Dino's or OG has staggered in here. I've been here when I had nowhere else to go. I've had this as my last meal before celebrating new years downtown. I've had lazy nights here with my g/f where we just sit and read the weekly's from the stands by the door. One of the reasons I loved our apartment so much was that it was about 10 minutes away. Delivery? Never even occurred to us, we wanted to go, we had to BE there. In that atmosphere.\n\nThank you Louie for all the great food! I'm sure my mother wants to meet the man that kept me well fed all those years.","useful":6}

It's not even mentioned on the Plaza Casino web page?!?!? We came across it incidentally after an even we went to in one of the banquet rooms. If you go to one of the upstairs restaurants, you can STILL miss seeing this?!?!\n\nJerky is one of those things I didn't get (understand the popularity of) until last year, really. There are a few people I know that occasionally get it. I used to be a mechanic and they sold it on the tool truck and the guys would buy it. I tried it, it was decent.\n\nI worked for a company that put me in a temporary position last year at Palace Station. There's a regular guest there that brings Venison jerky for some of the staff that works there and I happened to be there when he came in. amazing what a bag of jerky can do. Everyone loved this guy, he brightened the staff's day and he was the one on vacation! They all talked about his hunting trip, how he stores a lot in a spare fridge in his garage, the full deal. I generally don't like the idea of hunters or hunting, but someone that uses over 90% of what they hunted is alright by me. It's the wasted kill that is wrong.\n\nSo when I saw this store we had to go in, I had an appreciation. We bought all kinds, turkey links, teriyaki. Apparently Las Vegas Jerky's is not only a company that's in town, but it appears there are few stores that carry this brand, which is not bad. At least you know everything is freshly made. the only thing I saw wrong about it was that it WASN'T widely sold. this is a business you want to see excel. They have all kinds of dried shrimp, clam jerky?! Try this. They have all kinds of candies and dried fruit and nuts for sale also. We really stocked up when we went there. A lot of these are actually healthier treats for you also. Whenever I have an upset stomach or can't sleep, for some reason noshing on a few walnuts calms my stomach and I pass right out. \n\nThis is a family owned store and you can SEE all the happy customers that have been in here, the walls are covered with Polaroids (yes, the film they don't make anymore) of hundreds of people that have been in here. Pictures are signed.\n\nPart of the charm of stores, when you have time, is the conversations you have with the clerk. when there's a line, people get all business which is understandable when you're the one in a hurry. But this is one of the stores where you can talk with the owner and a lot of their family in a couple of visits. Business-wise, that builds more return customers that what most of those corporate surveys mislead companies to believe.\n\nand yes, they threw in a bonus with our purchase that we would have had no problem paying for!

CC is near my first Vegas ghetto apartment on Twain, now featuring bars on all the tenants doors! I was over 4 decades late of the swank celebrity resident days. \n\nHow could I not have gone in the last time I was in the neighborhood? \n\nI was actually scared the first time I drank there. It was in the afternoon and it had the old boys in their drinking their monthly check away, trying to haul the royal that will win the last few months back. Grissled Robert Duvall types, you know what I'm saying? It was enough to not make me go back for awhile and discover 2 other of my faves nearby, Madison and Rascal's. \n\nThe next time I was there was at night. The thing I love about Vegas bars is that at night you can see 20-30 somethings and the bar still isn't considered a college or hipster bar. People vacation and then move here to drink during those magical decades, before adult financial obligations take over or perhaps to create them. \n\n4 years later, I was happy when Dave Attell discovered this bar on his Insomniac show. Where the hell was I? Working? Passed out in some other bar? So close.\n\nThe red velvet walls. I want them plastered in every place I've ever lived.

I heart that the taps are just in the middle of an empty wall with a little drain under it. No, nothing else can go here, this is the draft beer altar. Thank you.\n\nI don't remember when, a common saying of bar recollections, but I came here to chase a few First Fridays. I remembered I didn't live nearby anymore and it wasn't convenient from downtown. So it had to have been for a woman, sad I can't remember her. That good a bar.\n\nOn one of the karaoke nights I think I discovered they had food. They had a table set up buffet style with some beef soaking in marinade to make sandwiches & such.

I got to respect, appreciate and even miss those old afternooners.\n\nRemember when I said I didn't go in the last time I was in the neighborhood? I lied. Nights later I went the HELL BACK IN and soaked in it's victorious juices. \n\nOne of the things I saw on face book and almost forgot about until I saw it was a GLORIOUS Champagne's Caf√© tee shirt.

If you look at the NYNY Hotel from the outside, you will see that there are several \"buildings\" that make up the rooms of the hotel.  For the Zanzabar Suite (and certainly some other room types) the exterior is green glass. In theory, it sounds nice, but after a few hours in the green glow, I was ready to leave.  It did not provide a good feeling.  Sound strange?  Check it out for yourself.  I have spoken to others who experienced the same thing.\n\nAs for the hotel and the amenities, I don't really know what to say.  I don't understand who NYNY is trying to target.  They have magnet stands and Nathan's Famous hot dogs for sale when you walk in, a roller coaster and arcade for kids, and a themed restaurant row.  However, it is all wrapped around a casino that is for adults.  Didn't Vegas give up on the \"kid friendly\" thing in the 90's?  Time to renovate?  I think they did...oh well.\n\nI can tell you that the worst massage I have ever received came from the spa in this hotel back in 1999.  I can also tell you that the pool is in a terrible location where most of the sunlight is blocked by the towers of hotel rooms.\n\nOn a lighter note, I once saw a guy in the NYNY casino win a small jackpot on the Wheel of Fortune machine.  The next day when I walked by the same machine, he was still sitting there.  I asked him how things were going and he said that the machine was still paying out.  He was smiling ear-to-ear.  The day after that when I walked by, the entire bank of machines had been removed from the casino.

It's the up and coming performers that have been performing for years. They may not have skyrocketed to national attention yet. \n\nI have seen her at Planet Ho at the V theater (the dirtiest name for a family theater) when her show had volunteers from the audience that were usually kids. Her delivery and interaction with the audience was admittedly a little stiff. there were pauses for reaction, when there were none. \n\nWhen we went to the Riviera, the theater wasn't... packed. But that means better seats. As a local, it does get unnerving that shows still don't sell more with all the discounted/ comped tickets out there, and this is summer time (when we saw the show). In the fall, I'll be saddened when the shows start shutting down from lack of business. \n\nBut sometimes Casino execs are smart enough to see that a theater that isn't packed is better than a closed theater taking up space. And chances are a new Show like Scarlett may be to replace Frank Marino's show, just because he had been there so long, they couldn't afford to pay the price for his longevity. A lot of companies lay off senior staff to have a new guy do the job for less.\n\nThere were no volunteers in this incarnation and I thought there were a lot of improvements.

Those last details were entirely beside the point.  He never expressed any out of the ordinary interest in this famous chain, but nonetheless we were left with a 25 dollar gift card and no choice but to man the crowded booths of our local Applebee's. \n\nIt's odd when you never go to chain restaurants how much you notice the differences between them and other places we normally eat.  We went on a Wednesday night and there were people waiting for a table.  Two million restaurants in Phoenix and these assholes are WAITING for mediocre chain food.  There were only two of us so we were seated promptly at a two top near the kitchen and instantly were mesmerized by the completely muddled,  incoherent memorabilia that lines the walls of this place.  A photo of Marilyn Monroe, next to a Route 66 sign, next to a football helmet, next to a baseball hat, next to a picture of Johnny Carson with a cigar or someshit.  Perhaps it is difficult, or rather simply unnecessary, to provide your restaurant with an easily deciphered theme.   \n\nNot that anyone who is eating at Applebee's gives a fuck. \n\nAnother thing I noticed about the ambiance is that this is certainly a watering hole for those afflicted with that whole \"obesity epidemic\" thing here in America.  And I'm not being a bitch, man, there were just a lot of fat people there.\n\nOur server, an over weight Latino man with a raspy voice and  purposeful speed takes our drink orders right away.  We both get Long Islands which are served in an obscenely sized goblet straight out of the 18th century.  I am small and I don't work out and I hate when drinks are fucking so heavy that I have to use two hands.  I understand that it is now a trademark of these types of restaurants to make their drinks large, colorful and spectacular- but I can't help but pretentiously think as I lift the four pound concoction of watered down syrup and ice, \"this is just fucking retarded.\"\n\nWe order a few appetizers; the spicy bone-in wings and mozzarella sticks.  The wings are dinky and under salted but not disgusting.  The mozzarella sticks were... mozzarella sticks.  You can't really go wrong or right with fried cheese but they got cold fast and the cheese hardened.  \n\nThe redeeming quality of our Applebee's outing was our likable and attentive server.  While we never really make our way to chain restaurants (as there is just so much other good shit Phoenix has to offer), it was sort of nice to have a friendly and non-hipster server.  A guy not concerned with spouting off specials and showing us the wine list and judging us if we order domestic instead of premium,  just a giant Mexican dude probably with a family of four at home trying to make some good tips.  And I guess that's always the nice, homey thing about chain places; it's all just so average and normal and sometimes that feels like comfort. \n\nI can't honestly say that I'll return to Applebee's anytime soon unless we come across another gift card from another relative that takes too many pictures and doesn't throw anything away, but I can say that it was an overall interesting experience to be out of our comfort zone, talking and watching the hoards of middle Americans order their steak and shrimp or chicken fried steak and shovel it in their mouth while they talk about how the fuck they're going to pay the mortgage this month.\n\nMaybe our server can pay HIS with the giant tip we left him.","useful":3}

It's nice to feel like you're out in nature when really, Monona/Madison, is really quite close. This area only offers 1.3 miles of trails and many of them are straight lines (to/from an entrance) and there's one brief loop. One downside is that there are no maps posted at the entrance(s) so you need to either bring one or have access to it on your phone so you don't just end up walking from one entrance to a different exit.

We feed them enough.\"\n\"Don't put your fingers in the fence. Animals bite, kick and butt.\"\n\"Cows bite. Do not approach the fence. Do not touch.\"\n\"DO NOT FEED THE ANIMALS, FUUUCK!\"\n\n...and yet, I saw dozens of infractions by both children and adults alike. Poking the animals and touching things meant to be untouched, reaching into the pens and climbing into cramped spaces. And guess who probably gets in trouble if something 'bad' happens?

There were two adults and over a dozen little ones that entertained me by chasing each other, rolling around in the mud, pouncing on each other and otherwise frolicking. The pigs are soooo cute, and apparently they are pretty hard to find, but love Canada's \"adverse climate\" so they thrive here. I could watch these pigs for hours.\n\nI had to remove a star for two reasons - one being the lack of proper signage around the farm (I inadvertently found myself in the adjacent park twice; the path isn't clearly marked to indicate that you're leaving the farm area) and the pens don't have large enough species indicators. Remember back in the day at the Metro Toronto Zoo where the ground was painted with hooves/paw prints leading you to certain animals? They could benefit from that here. \n\nThe second reason is the cows. \n\nThey looked extremely sad and it was hard to look at them. One of the cows was outside and roaming freely, chewing on something grassy and just generally hanging out. She looked OK, but kind of bored (I dunno, what do cows do?). There were two other cows stuck indoors at Francey Barn and they were in total darkness, tied by the collar with a two foot chain, which was scarcely long enough to allow them to dip their heads into the feeding and water trough. Why are they in here? And why can't they roam freely? Why so dark? It really bummed me out.\n\nCome here year round from 9am-5pm but come early if you don't enjoy the presence of children.

It's nothing like the Americanized Mexican / Latin places  you've been to before. \n\nDon't load up on the chips and salsa as the portions are big and you'll want to save room for what is to come.  Their house iced tea is very good if you want something other than a cold cerveza.\n\nAs Annie D said in her review, I highly recommend going with the Molcajete Caliente with verde sauce. You can't go wrong with that!  I ordered something else and ate off of Jared's Molcajete Caliente along with my own.  That sauce is incredible!\n\nNote that this place closes early during the week.  We met some friends there at 7pm and at 8:20 we were the last ones in there and we could tell the staff was ready to go home.  \n\nI can't wait to return to this local gem of a restauran for another memorable meal very soon.","useful":14}

Women wear dresses that push up that milk shelf. And there was a time I used to spike my hair up with gel and wear one of my silk, shiny club shirts. Where is that fire from 8 years ago?\n\nMany stories I heard of before the club when the area was the Lion's head entrance and Wizard of Oz Tribute was the previous incarnation of MGM. Each wing of the hotel used to have it's own color and theme. \n\nAt Grand adventures out back I experienced, where I met the street performers, one of which is still very much Wayne Brady. And I spent many times in a quiet wing of the hotel that I also used as a shortcut and a largely unknown public bathroom. I later found that it used to actually be the Marina I saw in many vintage pictures and postcards. \n\nFor a club on the strip, I'm amazed when I look back at how many nights I spent trying to work on my game here. Little did I know other landmark things in my life would happen here. \n\nStudio 54 is great simply because it's a club on the strip that retains it's original name and design for over 5 years, something other night clubs can't seem to do. And in it's preservation lies many memories of one of the first hangouts I can write about on yelp (since the Beach Club and Woody's, even Red Room are closed). I never understood though, why don't they ever have a disco night??\n\nThere are nice different little areas of the club and I have to admit, they had a VIP area before Light opened and ruined the club scene for me. But this was fun for me and my 2 closest club buds of mine at the time, Josh and Scotty.  \n\nEvery time we went, we were somehow able to scheme our way into their VIP. We were servers, but to score those cookies and finger sandwiches became the goal of the night for me rather than a phone number on a napkin. Satisfying my hunger seemed more obtainable than rounding 3rd. I got girls to talk to me when I intentionally left VIP with my hand up armed with cookies sticking out of a bev nap.\n\nJosh was a pretty boy whose sexuality Scott and I always questioned because he was somehow bored with women's leering to our dismay. They looked at him the way I looked at the Steak buffet at Sam's Town. I never got that look from a woman on first contact. Maybe I hung out with them so I could at least experience the shrapnel from such an explosion in what we referred to as \"fity fo.\" \n\nYears later, I was kinda talked into going to a Halloween party by 2 girls I kinda knew and one I didn't. One was a roller derby girl I knew from matches and the other someone I met years ago at the Fantasy and Fetish Ball, the year it was held at the Stardust right before they tore it down. I have the most stories from that single event than I do from the 3 \"tamest\" First Friday drinking stories I have. \n\nThe burlesque dancer I kinda knew, something sparked that night which led to many adventures after and also gained me a girlfriend and roommate. I had many train wreck handshake roommates, but this was the second time that my name was officially on a rental lease. It was the second best place I lived in Vegas, the other- on my own- was known as The Pointe (now Bella Vita) and actually had an identical floor plan to boot. It was cool to get an identical place years later, I knew where everything goes!\n\nSo fity fo is a place I could associate with my favorite holiday and anniversary.\n\nBack when, me and the guys used to spend time after in what used to be the center stage lounge before it became a bevtainer bar and sportsbook. We'd see girls stagger out as we assessed the night and wondered what we were going to do next, often Drai's that went on past 7:00AM. Not only did I spend nights out til sunrise, but 80 degree LATE morning sunlight and rising. \n\nGod, was I ever that young? \n\nIt was a time when I had control over a good corner of my life. I have spent a majority of my time thinking how I could get that back with no budget or resources.\n\nIt's a vicious circle, I can't get the spark without a paycheck, nor a paycheck until the impression I give in an interview overpowers the dark mysteries of a brick wall the reference checks hold.\n\nI am close to getting my stride back. On a different dance floor, in a dance instruction club.","useful":1}

Two YEARS of that nightmare. Change of address cards were so horrible I still have a Post Office box, even though we have lived at the same place for almost 2 years now. I'm that traumatized from the experiences.\n\nSo during all this, I did a George Carlin and was looking all over for a Place For My Stuff! I would up getting storage here and eventually moved my things a CARLOAD at a time to and from here. My g/f also was going thru a similar thing and we had to move all her stuff to a storage also for a brief time. We actually had to get her stuff from another storage from a place that was decades north on Rancho. \n\nThe Manager was interesting, but nice. He had a funny laugh. anyone remember Squiddly Diddly? sounds like he's gargling. They have a security gate and you get a pass code to use during storage hours. The storage itself was fine, it's always horrific to see how much crap you have in boxes, especially when they approach the ceiling of a storage unit. There were openings at the top of the unit that bled into others. You can conceivably reach your arm in there or if you're a pro, rig a grappling device to pull others things thru. I basically tried to stack things at least away from an arms reach if someone really had that much time to kill to fish for crap I want to sell at a flea market. \n\nYou do have to buy/use your own padlock and I recommend buying before because of course they mark up all the stuff they sell there. I have the very difficult to bolt cut off circular kind. Want it? I still have it and both keys not being used. \n\nThe agent was very thorough about the lease and describe all the actions to be taken, if we didn't pay the rent, clean the place after, etc. No illegal storage. But what caught my attention was abandoned things were to be auctioned in lots after a certain time if you no show and they confiscate your things. \n\nI always wondered about these auctions that storage units have, just like post office, police and airport auctions. You don't know what you're getting, but there's incredible potential. There could be one little box filled with jewelry in all that crap. \n\nI decided if I ever could get rid of all my crap, buy someone else's crap for cheaper to do some treasure hunting. Or I could wind up with tons of incomplete kitchen sets and used kids toys. Eh.\n\nWe were respectful and got all our stuff out without incident. You do get to check out a lot of people moving their things if you're stuck doing things the carload way.

Also, if you're a large group (4+) please don't come to Aunties because there's hardly any room for you. \n\nNow that those sobering facts are out of the way, let's talk about the actual food. I ordered the scrambled eggs combo with hash browns and toast. The toast was of the challah variety with sesame seeds on top but it wasn't 'sweet' egg bread the way I like it. It was semi-buttered but an extra bowl of butter came our way so I was happy about that. The hash browns were actually just boiled and fried potatoes and sweet potatoes and they were SUPER good. The scrambled eggs were poorly cooked (kind of soggy) but I was so famished by the time our food came that it nearly went unnoticed. \n\nWith only two people sweating up a storm in the kitchen I was surprised how quickly our food came.

The \"PK Sandwich\" consists of crispy breaded tofu, oven roasted tomatoes, sliced avocado and cilantro dijon mayo on toasted flax served with baked homefries and mixed greens ($9.50). With that I had a V6 juice (freshly juiced tomato, spinach, carrot, celery, beet and green pepper). \n\nWhat I like about the fresh juices here is that they come in three sizes, the smallest of which is actually quite affordable if all you want is a sampling of flavour. I believe it's $3 for 250mL. \n\nMy sandwich was excellent - so good, in fact, that I ordered it again a few days later when I dined with Greg C, along with the soup of the day, tomato rice.

When I asked my regular vet for another referral, they gave me ASG without hesitation and I can see why.\n\nFrom the first phone call to set up a consultation to several visits later, I've had only extremely positive experiences with ASG.  The facility is immaculate and uses all of the latest and greatest technology and the entire staff couldn't be more professional (and I've corresponded with all of them.)\n\nKaren, my initial point of contact, was friendly and sympathetic, when I made that first phone call, and she scheduled me in asap and followed up to confirm the day before.\n\nRob and Rebecca, the CVTs (Certified Vet Techs) were both amazing with me and Minnie during each of our visits as well, and Emileigh was also extremely supportive and knowledgeable when I picked Minnie up after the procedure she had at ASG.  The real reason to go to ASG though, is for Dr. Lirtzman aka Ross.  He is the most personable doctor that I've met in a really long time.  He took the time to hear all about Minnie's history and explain to me in detail what was going on.  He showed me x-rays, he drew pictures, he used props, etc... and he didn't pressure me to make fast decisions on next steps either.  \n\nWhen I decided to move forward with a procedure at his office, I was given a call and email to actually watch the procedure done online live while it was happening - it was very cool to see.  In addition, the staff cleaned Minnie up afterwards... so much that it appeared that she had been bathed.  And the topper?  Minnie was recovering over a holiday weekend and I was given Dr Lirtzman's personal cell phone number in case of emergency.\n\nSeveral weeks later, Minnie is still recovering, but she's doing a ton better than before we visited ASG and I'm optimistic that with ASG's help, she will start using her leg even more than she is now.  I am confident we are in the best hands in the Valley with this office.  \n\nI don't wish pain to anyone's pets, but if for some reason you find yourself in a position to take your fur baby to a specialist, I highly recommend going here.

We hiked along the Ice Age Trail (on-leash area for dogs) and were really pleased with the prairies, rolling hills, wooded areas, and Oak Savanna.  Another bonus is how the trail laces through the park, away from the road, so you don't hear all the traffic noise.  There is also a huge off-leash area which offers a similar sort of trail through many acres, long enough to tucker out the pooch as you wind through the park. It is definitely more of a park for hiking around versus standing around.

It's a fun game to play!\n\nTop 5 Things To Buy At Bulk Barn:\n- dried pears (I try not to buy too many of these cause they make you poop weird)\n- exotic types of flour, like spelt, quinoa, amaranth, chickpea, soy, etc.\n- gluten-free stuff (this section is colossal)\n- baking and decorating supplies\n- candy, including Chews, Swedish Berries, Swedish Fish and peanut butter M&Ms. Oh, and something weird and perplexing called \"WASS-UB? EE\" (see pic)\n\nThere is high product turnover at this location so things are relatively fresh and well stocked. Every time I go there is a manager milling around, tidying up or stocking bins. There is pride in the organization of the store.\n\nAs far as I can see, this is the only relatively accessible (by public transit) Bulk Barn location in Toronto. You can take the Queen streetcar to Leslie and walk down, or the 31B bus from Greenwood station (on the Danforth line). Or take the Leslie exit from Lakeshore if you're driving.\n\nThe only thing I don't love about this Bulk Barn is that its hours are not consistent with the adjoined Loblaws - it closes earlier than the grocery store (11pm).  \n\nAnd remember: SNACKING HURTS US ALL!","useful":13}

Even better (for those with friendly doggies) is the off-leash area.  The park is huge, offering a trail that runs in a loop all around the park with crisscrossing trails in between.  To walk the entire loop around the perimeter takes us about 45min and we usually encounter about 15 other dog groups along the way (on an average nice weekend afternoon).  Every weekend the parking lot is packed but it's easy to escape into the park and not feel overwhelmed by people in the least.  If you want your dog to play more with other dogs there often are folks gathered near the front gate, allowing for the dogs to socialize.  One other really nice feature of the off-leash trail is that there are actually garbage cans about 10 min into your walk.  You mean I don't have to carry around a bag of poop for half an hour?!  Perfect!!  There is no water here though so be sure to bring some because your pooch will be thiiiiirsty by the end of a 45min loop + puppy play time at the front gate!   Love it.

The sweet potatoes were melt-in-your-mouth velvety and perfectly seasoned. \n\nThe gnocchi was otherworldly. The flavour combination rendered me absolutely speechless. It was more than your usual \"gnocchi swimming in tomato sauce\" - it was a substantial meal with lots of garnishes and contents to it. Pine nuts! Lemon! Spinach! SO GOOD!\n\nWhen the server brings out your food, they present it to you like you're some sort of tsar - they point to it and run down the endless list of ingredients and components in case you forgot what you ordered or were so in awe of the presentation that you couldn't tell what you were looking at. \n\nThe prices are absurdly out of my usual range but you know what you're getting into when you make a reservation, and I have nothing but praise for the food. Watch out for drinks because it can quickly get expensive. Make sure you ask for a drink menu so you know how much you're spending because they have wine bottles priced up to $2000 (my friend thought the YEAR was 2000, but alas, it was the price).\n\nA few times throughout the evening we saw a familiar character, chef Susur Lee himself lurking around the dining room and inspecting people's plates, making his presence known. Scott informed us that he randomly comes back to Toronto to work at Madeline's and that people call all the time asking if tonight will be the night that he's there, but that they never know in advance. It's just random.\n\nThe only thing that disappointed me was what I will refer to as the Great Cake Debacle Of 2009‚Ñ¢. My friend baked and brought a cake for the birthday and Madeline's charged us a $5 PER PERSON plating fee. I can understand charging $20 or something for cutlery and plates, but almost everyone had ordered the tasting menu, which includes dessert anyway, which we weren't going to eat. So that would cancel out the complaint about having to sully plates and cutlery. $5 per person at 15 people is $75. A bit absurd. \n\nHad it been my birthday I would have gone across the street to Second Cup and busted out the paper plates and plastic cutlery and jammed on the cake right then and there!","useful":9}

The service was sadly disappointing - it's like, I'm trying to transport myself to a Parisian Paradise here - please don't be a buzzkill.\n\nThe food was scrumptious as always - I ordered the soup du jour (butternut squash and tomato puree), a pain au chocolat and fresh homemade raspberry iced tea. All three were outstanding and the pain au chocolat actually rendered me speechless with its freshness and flaky, buttery (literally) texture.\n\nA few minutes after I seated myself and had glanced at the menu I knew what I wanted. The server came over and handed me the table menu, as if I wouldn't have been able to do it myself or have noticed that there was a menu sitting on my table all along. Kind of in a \"Hurry up and decide what you want\" way. I told her I was ready to order and she begrudgingly wrote it down but didn't make any eye contact or acknowledge the order - just walked away. No \"are you ready to order?\" or \"Great, comin' right up!\" or similar retort that I'm used to at BB.\n\nTen minutes later I hadn't so much as received a glass of water to tide me over while waiting for my food. My pain au chocolat arrived first, but with nothing to wash it down with I had a hard time eating it. My iced tea arrived some minutes later and then the soup - again, no eye contact or acknowledgement when dropping off any of these items. The service was at the busboy level, almost as if instructed \"don't talk to the customer.\"\n\nMy soup was on the \"gazpacho\" (read: cold) side but my server was too disinterested to do the standard check-in with me after dropping the food off, and I was actually pressed for time so I didn't say anything. Please note that the place was nowhere near being full and there was ample staff on hand, so it's not like she was swamped with tables to serve. \n\nAfter my plates were cleared she didn't so much as ask me if I wanted anything else or if she could bring me the bill. I waited for 10 minutes with my bag on my shoulder and money in hand but she didn't come around with the bill, so I finally got up and asked another server behind the counter for my bill, which forced a conversation with the subpar server, who didn't even apologize that I had been relegated to going up to the counter and requesting it, or even glance at me. I paid, took exact change and left.\n\nA very disappointing visit to Bonjour Brioche compared to my usual peppy weekly visits.

If I were you, I'd be wary of even walking through that front door, because once you claim one of their products as your own, you'll never settle for anything else. And with only one Kiehl's (as far as I know) in all of Toronto, it's a dangerous addiction to have. \n\nSome evidence...\n\nThe \"Supremely Gentle Eye Makeup Remover\" is the only makeup remover that will ever touch my eyes. It's a lotion-based makeup remover, unless some of the grotesque oil-based removers out there that leave your face greasy and necessitate tugging. It's smooth, easy on your delicate eye area and doesn't smell weird. I wear dramatic eye makeup most days and this gets all of it off in a snap.\n\nMore evidence...\n\nThe \"Creme de Corps Soy Milk & Honey Body Polish\" is the only scrub I'll ever use. Once you use this scrub, any other exfoliating scrub will seem too gritty, dry or wimpy for your calluses. This is the real deal - it gives you an unbeatable scrubdown and it smells like honey. Oh, and it has jojoba oil in it, which is essential what the sub-species of Humans  With The Softest Skin On Earth‚Ñ¢ swear by. I've tried other scrubs from Aveda, Philosophy, etc. and I always come back to this one because it just gets the job done, pure and simple.\n\nOK fine - a third piece of evidence...\n\nAre you using eye cream yet? And if not, why not? You know you should be, if only to start preventing those pesky signs of aging. The \"Creamy Eye Treatment with Avocado\" has a really unique texture and a small container of it, while a little pricey, will last you forever because it goes on really thick. The only thing that could make it better would be SPF 30. \n\nWhen you visit, make sure Zach's working. You'll be able to spot him because he'll be jamming to Lady Gaga, Britney Spears or Kylie, and he'll rush up to you and say \"Oh my god - have you TRIED the new [fancy, convoluted product name that of course you didn't know about but are like, so ready to try like this very instant] yet??\" You'd think Zach was a descendant of the original founders of Kiehl's back in the 19th century; he just knows everything about Kiehl's and its products to a terrifying degree. \n\nThe store sometimes has special makeover nights and product launches, so get on their mailing list so that you'll get invited to them. Another win about Kiehl's is that they're very generous with their product samples, and some of them are good enough to last you months of sampling. It's nice to be able to try stuff before you buy, especially since they have a pretty massive arsenal of products to offer.","useful":17}

I dilly-dallied about my order selection and finally decided on the \"strictly vegetarian\" black bean soup (soup of the day!) and a bean and squash pupusa. \n\nLuckily for us the folks in the kitchen fire out food at such a mind-numbing pace that it wasn't long before our dinner was ready and brought out to us (in waves, might I add, as we received a few unexpected add-ons like a bowl of onions, avocado slices, some weird salad with jalapenos on it and a brown slurry that may have been hot sauce...or soup.)\n\nThe black bean soup was fairly brothy (not a puree as I'd been expecting) and brimming with rice and whole black beans. It was a bit spicy and the portion was enormous so I didn't even get halfway through it before I had to get started on my pupusa. \n\nAccording to what Wiki tells me, pupusas have been around for nearly 3000 years and were eaten by \"the natives\" back in the day. They're a thick, hand-rolled maize (corn) tortilla that kind of looks like a pancake or a crepe, but is stuffed with a variety of things like \"chicharr√≥n\" (fried pork rinds), cheese, beans or ayote squash, which is green and stringy like zucchini.\n\nUnfortunately I wasn't a huge fan of the pupusa - it was too bland for my tastes. It was in dire need of a flavour intervention by way of chilis or hot sauce. Even sour cream would have helped its cause. \n\nThe entire meal was made more entertaining by the inclusion of a Mexican Telenovela on the big screen TV. I have NO idea what the name of this soap opera was, but it was hilarious. It was super dramatic, every actress burst into tears at least once per scene, and the entire thing took place in a hospital.

This was the best fondue of the bunch (cheese was sharp/zesty) but the grape tomatoes and asparagus served for dipping were pitiful servings.

All of the chocolate had to be pre-melted a bit. \n\n1) Belgian Chocolate ($15)\nValrhona dark Manjari chocolate with French macarons, biscotti, layfingers, bananas, strawberries. Yummy, although the portion seemed smaller than the usual chocolate fondue served at Bier Markt. The dipping vehicles, with the exception of the biscotti, were scrumptious.

With two moving professionals it took 3.5 hours plus thirty minutes' travel time to the new place. I was anticipating that it'd take less than three hours and would cost about $250 but it ended up costing $400 plus tip. I still haven't figured out the math but that seems like a lot more than I was quoted. Whatever - at least I didn't have to lift a box, right?\n\nThe movers were almost half an hour late but luckily I wasn't in a rush to get out of my current place or into my new one. The two guys, Nathan and Jordan, were very friendly and professional and had done many, many moves before this one. \n\nI'm pretty sure part of the reason the move took so long was because they wrapped so much of stuff in blankets and bubble - a lot of it unnecessarily. The instructions that I gave were basic - nothing was really fragile and certainly nothing was antique or vintage. Just throw it in the truck and let's go. At one point I saw one of the guys wrapping my shitty 1980s 19\" TV as if it was a rare Faberge Egg - this is the same TV that I couldn't shake on Craigslist for $20.\n\nThey didn't bring the standing wardrobes as advertised and also requested - because of this I had to wrap my hanging clothes in garbage bags at the last minute and most of them barely it into my new closet intact - everything kept falling off the hangers and onto the floor. Needless to say this was a huge nuisance. I was most looking forward to seeing this marvel of moving.\n\nThe movers aren't insured to bring you to your new apartment as a passenger in their truck, so if like most people in the city you don't have access to a car, be prepared to take a cab or beg a friend (my method) to drive you to your new apartment. I didn't know about this rule so luckily a friend was able to pull through at the last minute. If the moving company beats you there they won't get started till you arrive so it's worth it to leave a little earlier than they do. \n\nNothing was broken or damaged and I was overall happy with the move - just wish it had taken less time and not been so pricey. Be prepared to spend more than you had anticipated and you'll be OK. \n\nAlso, try to have water or some other beverage handy for the movers - they were sweating up a storm and it was 30C outside (and probably in my apartment as I'd already turned off the A/C), and I had packed all my glasses and had nothing to drink. So think ahead on this one!\n\nPayment by cash or cheque (tip only by cash).","useful":13}

He seemed like a genuinely \"good person\" - you know how you just get that vibe from some people? He was one of them.\n\nSIDENOTE: It's important to note the discrete divisions in the roti family - there's the typical West Indies roti (like Bacchus, Island Foods, Triple X, etc.) and there's the South Asian roti (like Gandhi) which is essentially curry in a wrap/roti. You can be a fan of one, neither or both but it's hard to claim a 'best roti' if you're including both types, ya know?

Once, I would have ended up holding boob baggies (hilarious bit) and the other time I would have been sans shirt on the orgy bed.  Thanks, honey.  The guy and girl who were called up for the orgy bed scene actually ended up being mother and son.  That made it even funnier.\n\nDuring our show, there was a couple in the audience that had been married for 59 years.  They were from Australia.  The host brought them up on stage and asked them some questions.  One question, directed at the husband was whether or not he participated in a threesome back in the day.  His answer was, \"Yes, we had quite a few threesomes back in Australia\".  When the host turned to his wife and asked if she was there, she responded with \"Oh yes!\"  Everybody was cracking up.  They must have been in their 70's or 80's.\n\nNot your typical Cirque show, but definitely worth a try unless you are uber conservative, boring, up tight, or uncomfortable in your own skin.

When you arrive, even though the salon is busy, you're greeted by someone and told a wait time (less than 10 minutes). \n\nMara was my nail technician and she was wonderful. I warned her of my raw, ragged cuticles and she went easy on them while still filing my nails into a nice squoval shape. I chose a deep purple from the OPI Russian collection (\"Midnight In Moscow\") as my tester polish. The polish selection here really outstanding - they had more OPI than I've seen in a dog's age, as well as Nubar, Essie and some China Glaze. I had a really hard time narrowing down my picks. My solution? Come back a week later to do it all over again...\n\nCUTICLE WORK/MISHAPS:\nFlawless - no missteps.\n\nHAND MASSAGE:\nReally great. My eyelids not only closed, but actually started to flutter (also known as dreaming).\n\nPOLISH APPLICATION:\nExpert. The bottle of polish was a bit glumpy so Mara thinned it out with thinner before continuing. After the polish was applied, she used a stiff art brush dipped in nail polish remover to do some very minor touch ups. My manicure lasted six days without a single chip, which is really excellent considering how dark the polish was!\n\nEXTRA NOTES: \n* Cuticle oil is applied with a small paint (art) brush, and it feels wonderful. After you sit at the drying station for about ten minutes, your technician comes over and flicks your nails to test for dryness. Then a weird shellac is sprayed over to harden the coat.\n* The clientele here is mostly trashy and unkempt. Star Nails is right across from Gerrard Square (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/gerrard-square-shopping-centre-toronto). While waiting for my nails to dry I overheard two separate phone conversations delivering or receiving news of teenage pregnancies. \n\n$13. Cash, credit and debit all accepted!","useful":17}

We both enjoyed the herbal iced tea of the day and we shared an order of the tempeh lettuce wraps, the daily soup inspiration, and the curry vermicelli rice noodle bowl.  It was just the right amount of food... it was tasty and light and all of the flavors went well together.  I've also enjoyed the macro platter on previous visits.  \n\nWe had great service from Carrie and Ali, and we heard that there is live music every Thursday night and that they may be starting a movie night sometime soon too.  Could be pretty cool!  Carrie informed us that 'mandala' means \"circle\" in sanskrit. There are beautiful magic mandala artwork throughout the restaurant.  When you look at them, you almost lose yourself in the intricate details in each one, and there is deep meaning behind them as well.  \n\nI noticed that Mandala has a kids menu as well as some delicious looking desserts.

There was a warm up/ opening acts section of the show. Most noticeably was Joan Armstrong and a few others that asks the question, why didn't they get guest billing status on the posters? \n\nI believe there was another group doing Sgt. Pepper at Railhead about a year or so ago? I don't know about that version. also, I can understand Rock Star was premeditated, but all the other Beatles Music tie ins lately... How much was orchestrated by Michael Jackson to make money from the rights and how many were rushed after he died, to make money for the estate? I can't imagine Macy's come together being intentionally planned too far in advance. \n\nThere were a lot of surprises and a lot fo appreciation applause going on in the audience. This was a respectable crowd, but there's a part of my mind tugging at comparing to Monster Circus, the other rock show I saw there months before (also reviewed). \n\nStrange, no smell of pot during the concert. The \"wildest\" thing were a few girls standing up and \"old fogies\" (tongue in cheek, they're my age) yelling at them to sit down. \n\nThere were little if no synthesizer, prerecorded crap during the show. the doorbells when I'm 64 were there, a 6 person vocal backup, a sitar section, a kid's choir, strings and horns. Even Will Farrel's favorite instrument was featured in probably the only Beatles song of the night to have cowbell (name that song).\n\nRick threw out cusom pics all night (not just off stage) with some sweet revenge from the orchestra after the last number. holy crap, he even gave his guitar to some kid int he audience after the song. Everyone was so stunned, the kid kept standing there waiting for him to take it back until halfway thru the next song.\n\nI cheated, I looked at the program.

I noticed Ricks 6-neck guitar sitting behind him all night ready  to be played and it wasn't. And at the end of the show, that was it. It's probably the only concert I've ever been to that didn't have an encore. And they could have played one of their songs, I couldn't get She's Tight out of my head. Everyone's played the other top 5 requests out. \n\nSo we were herded out, I decided to pass on the shirt. And later in my insomnia almost killed myself after seeing what the shirts went for on ebay.

When I was ready to leave, my hands were sprayed with some sort of aerosol solvent (presumably a sealant? I wasn't informed of the product name or reason for its use).

Not impressed.\n\nEXTRA NOTES:\n* The polish selection was mediocre (~20 colours). Thankfully I had thought to bring my own because they didn't even have my signature red OPI colour. \n* The table you sit at is the same as my kitchen table at home (http://www.remodelista.com/img/sub/stainless-steel-store-table.jpg) but my chairs at home are more comfortable. For a 30 minute mani I expected a bit more cushioning. \n* There is no pricelist in the salon so check the website before you go\n* The tools are sanitary and new ones are used for each new client\n\nPOLISH DURATION:\n2 days. I usually wait a week after a manicure before I formulate a rating so I can see how long the manicure actually holds up. I'm trying to think of any strenuous hand activities I might have participated in this week that would cause such premature chipping. Was it the sink of dinner dishes I washed? The can of Red Bull I opened? The stickers I peeled off my fruit? Dunno, but here we are on Friday and only 1 out of 10 nails is unchipped.\n\nHere's the kicker: $31. My jaw actually dropped when I heard the total. Even if my manicurist had been skilled enough to warrant a repeat visit (not only was this not the case, but she seemed to not really care about the craft at all), I simply can't afford to come here every week. For the price of one Ten Spot mani I can get a month's worth of weekly manis at one of my usual places. My manis are typically $8-12 and sometimes $15, but never more than that. This was twice as much as the next most expensive, and hardly justified.","useful":11}

However, the community table is an option if you go solo or with a small group.\n\nAnother warning - the parking situation at noon - I think I lucked out and got the last spot in the lot; I happened to see a truck leaving when I came in, but there didn't seem to be any other open spots.  I noticed that Durant's next door offered 'humble valet parking' (interesting signage), but not sure if you are dining at Switch where you would park in this scenario.\n\nI walked in through the back, and I liked the atmosphere and vibe immediately.  I was told there was a 20 minute wait for my party of 3, so I found myself a seat and did some work while I waited.  Pretty sure they have WiFi although I was using my Verizon card.  Great people watching was distracting me too; enough so that I missed when the rest of my party walked in!  Anyways, I caught up with them and enjoyed a great lunch...\n\nService was right on, and it was an overall delightful dining experience.  I had the 'Super Chop' salad - it had a little bit of everything in it (artichokes, olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, corn, sunflower seeds, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach & field greens) - and I added turkey for a small extra charge... it was a huge serving and the perfect healthy lunch!  (Note to self and to anyone else that may be interested in adding protein to your salad in the future - go with something other than the turkey... I hate to sound picky, but it wasn't amazing).  Anyways, my two new friends (Kate and Angie) are regulars at Switch, so they ordered the hummus and lamb apps and shared - good idea!  I tried the hummus and it was tasty - I like how they served it with pita and sides of artichokes and peppers.  It was a tad different than the hummus at Fez, or at least that is what we all decided.\n\nWe were all very satisfied and too full for dessert... I guess I'll have to come back to try that another time.  Dessert and a bunch of other menu items that sounded good.

It was one of the few venues that featured local bands and appealed to the under 21 crowd. That's a rarity in the valley, the biggest advancement of all ages shows on the strip was in the earliest incarnation of Gameworks, when it had the climbing structure in the coke bottle. \n\nWould Jillian's replacement be worthy? I went in with a big open mind, which is necessary here.\n\nFirst thing you notice outside is, how do I put it nicely? Well, they didn't. It's not a truck scale. It's to weigh those that challenge it's 350 lb. mark. If you're heavier than that, you get to eat for free, the details of which I'm not sure of. I'm guessing it's not for a side salad.\n\nSince I didn't have much time, I decided to go in for a PBR and because I was reluctant to binge in a place that encouraged it on this level. \n\nA new place has a \"lot to take in\" factor when you enter, must be a board of tourism rule more than a one of fine dining. Before you can visually climatize a couple of hostesses (let's face it, there's no hosts in a breastaurant) put a cloth gown on you. You realize everyone is dressed this way. Is that their form of a bib? \n\nThey put a strap on your wrist, get it it's like a hospital patients'?! There are Vegas restaurants that want you to advertise to other tourists where you've been. Where did they get that big white paper hat? We have to eat there!(?) Where'd they get that guitar you can drink from? Let's go there!\n\nThey hand you a menu, that lets you know you can buy it on the cover. I sat at the bar because I love bar service for several reasons. At this bar, there's a \"doctor\" bartender. I could focus on the carnival that unfolds in this place. \n\nThere's a lucky strike cigarette machine (unfiltered). There are servers dressed in tight cleavage nurse outfits. If you're eating here, chances are you've heard about the people who have actually died that have had some connection to the place. While other businesses would shun this, this place advertises it. A local has their ashes on the bar and I heard the bartender tell his story 4 times the time I was there. For 1 beer.\n\nWith a wooden paddle, nurses actually spank guys that don't finish their burgers, so you better not have to pee or crap if you can't finish. See how funny it is that a cute nurse gets to spank a guy while you eat dinner? \n\nThey offer 4 burgers for their menu, the difference being the number of patties. They took a cue from the success of In-n-out burger's minimal menu. But at least HAG offers pickles, bacon and mustard. \n\nOn the walls there are  a lot of collages of images, 3 kinds: 1) towards the bathroom, there are all kinds of classic pieces of art with a HAG modification of it, maybe to appeal to \"higher class,\" patrons? 2) on the far back wall are pop movie posters, each has a HAG modification, to appeal to 20-30 somethings, get it? 3) a mural on the far wall of the last supper, and the participants are fast food mascots eating with a doctor from HAG, to appeal to kids, get it? \n\nIt's a big lesson in ad marketing, mix your brand with successful, well known symbols as if to be endorsed by them, using them under the copyright loophole of spoofing. Star Max Wars, get it? With Luke Maxwalker. \n\nThis place seems to cater to the bachelor/ette crowds, as well as the people that give the guy they know that coughs with their smoking problem a pack of cigarettes. It's based on peer dares, weather or not you can \"handle it.\"\n\nYeah, I got the jokes. And in Vegas, I certainly have handled many challenges of unsafe drinking, drugs and sexual uh... This place is crawling with gimmickry and I just felt like I was in front of planet hollywood, with all the ads yelling at me with flashy lights and people sticking fliers in my face.\n\nThis place is like tabloid tv, it may be fun to check out and \"laugh at,\" but I wouldn't want to be a regular part of it until I became it.","useful":6}

I don' giv' fug. \n\nSpeaking of Dive bars (see my last review)...\n\nThe first time I went here was with a bartender I dated. I never considered going out with a bartender before Vegas and I actually hadn't until she asked me out. She Asked me why I didn't ask her and it was because I saw literally hundreds of guys on her watch lay their raps and she saw thru all that crap. So I never considered it. It was a big deal, I was nervous. The band went on stage and blasted their amps and the singers were creaming in such a high pitched yell and my date started thrashing her head around, my body felt like I dropped a hiking backpack off behind me. I looked at the windows to make sure they were holding. Feedback was a romantic ballad to this band. An awesome first time on several fronts.\n\nThey had a good kitchen, good variety. But it was a lot of finger food. It's tough because everyone starts pawing at it. I don't mind sharing, but I'm a germophobe. People can fork at it, but no one's going to do that here. Comes with the territory. I actually knew one of the kitchen workers from working with him at another restaurant. A rule I follow, always look for a shill. They will come into play whenever you need them to. \n\nThere's a comfort level I couldn't explain here. I never thought I'd think of a punker bar as having a \"family feel,\" but that's what I experienced every time. Yeah, they didn't have drafts, but they did have tall boy PBR's and, AND the bar was one of the few in town that didn't have video poker. It retrospect, would the extra income have been worth renewing the lease? \n\nI have seen many friends here perform, they even had rockabilly/ psychobilly and more towards metal bands here. They even had burlesque nights! Vegas has always been a great melting pot of people. In most of my hangouts like this, if you want to categorize people here, I have seen punkers, rockers, goths, derby girls, zombie pub crawlers, all friends of mine. I recognize many from other bars/ events. I have seen people doing coke in their seats during a show and a couple having sex in a booth in the back corner by the pool table. Just another night in The LV.\n\nIf I came from work, I understandably had to ditch my tie. I lived around the corner for a while and it was when I started the infamous Bus phase that loomed over me for 3 jobs after my freighter class molester van took it's last dump. \n\nI heard about the Soprano's pinball machine glass being broken. I also heard about the alleged porn that may or may not have been filmed there. I have to ask around at AVN someday and follow some names. If I have to look at new porn every day until I find it, I will.\n\nWith Divebar gone, that part of the strip mall will probably be leveled with no more tenants. Even a western store and seasonal Halloween store couldn't stay open there. Even the anchor of the block, the Taiwal-mart closed, I thought a victory was scored. But of course it just remodeled. All of the smaller sections of the strip mall all the way to Pecos have had many empty storefronts for as long as I could remember. Really, all the remaining businesses could be put in one corner and the other 2/3's of the land could be leveled for something new to revitalize the area. But everyone is where they're at. That reminds me of times at Loose Caboose before I discovered Divebar. I used to go there after working at a restaurant nearby when I first moved to Vegas. That's a whole other review.\n\nI got to know the bartenders there, like Angie and Treika. They would bring in sick movies or some obscure porn to play on the tvs. there are a handful of bars in town that do this. It's a great break from the sports on most tv's in the valley. It was always fun to go there. I think concepts like Dick's last resort take their rude concept from punk bars. It's strange, when you're really an asshole, it's cool. But when servers are nice, you look for what's really going on.  \n\nGonna miss fun times there. I never think to buy shirts of places because I think they'll always be around. Too many of my favorite places are closing with this damn Depression. But I will continue to write about what these small places are doing right, hoping some day developers will get the idea from locals that they want something else to do than another $600+ bottle service ultra abortion lounge.\n\nCan I have the recipe for pirate's blood? Where will the sticker wall go? And the skeleton in a cage? They are now museum pieces. I never thought of buying a tee shirt from a lot of my favorite places.

You can pick up your supplies or have them delivered (for a fee).  Weekends get busy so it's bests to plan ahead and get your order in early so you can get the delivery time you want!  Also, they're not open Sundays so be sure to get what you need for the weekend on Friday/Saturday or you're going to be twiddling your thumbs on Sunday when you run out of something.  \n\nThe delivery trucks can usually hold two different items (i.e., dirt and mulch, gravel and sand) and only a certain amount of weight of each.  Again, planning ahead can help you figure out how to be as efficient as possible.  You also can pick up your gravel (or whatever you need) if you have a truck, be prepared to drive yourself onto the scale get weighed before and after so they know how much to charge you after a backhoe fills your truck up!  \n\nWe filled our raised bed garden with their 50/50 blend (dirt & compost) and our tomato plants are currently about 5ft high and look like a tomato forest.

When I left, I found out something very disturbing as to why I haven't before. It has nothing to do with the establishment or reputation, so don't let that dissuade you.\n\nOut front, you see that it's in a strip mall and it's not a huge place. You go inside and it has the feel of a sports bar, but with a lot of families and bustle going on all around. Right away you see piles of napkins, bibs and seafood debris. No, it's not Aria, but that's what I like. People were comfortable eating with their hands, doing what needed to be done to get to their dinner locked in various shells and exoskeletons.\n\nService was the first and lasting thing I noticed. Someone sat me, and while I was deciding, 2 others came up to ask me if I was ready, what I may need, what to drink, etc. It was a tag team effort I appreciated. I have worked a lot of restaurants, and I know you have maybe 4-5 tables to take care of and honestly, 99% of servers don't give a shit about tables not in their section, \"they're not tipping ME,\" or if the the customer has a problem with them, it blows YOUR tip. But here, servers help every table they walk by. \n\nThere were people waiting to be seated and 2 large groups were less than half occupying their tables pushed together. The only problems I had in this is seeing the solution. Some restaurants have a policy of not seating large groups until they all arrive which is how the first should have been handled. With the campers at the other party, I have and seen other servers take a table as people from the large group leave to set it up for a new 2/4 top. \n\nThe tables are funny, the table cloth is plain white plastic and the napkins are rolls of paper towels. I find it comforting because they don't mess around, there is high volume picking and peeling going on here.\n\nThe menu is a simple piece of paper with most options listed on it and the spiciness of how you want it prepared. Aside from crawfish, there's shrimp, crab, much more. Damn, I can't find my copy of the menu they let me have... They also sell sides, so I got rice expecting some broth with my order. I ordered a medium spicy combo. I can talk about different types of spicy all day, scoville units, the whole thing. But this had a nice lingering spiciness to it. Drinking soda (acids) doesn't help extinguish spicy food, but I was being good because I had to drive. No, beer wouldn't have helped, either. It may help some people to bring antacid if they want to show off.  Ask them what the market rate prices are listed on the menu so you can compare, or don't get surprised.\n\nDinner was served, a server unceremoniously plopped a pound bag of crawfish on my table. Hahahaha. Rice came a few minutes later and I was already in my plastic bag. Crawfish is big in my family and I'm from the bay area. There is a LOT of work busting open the shells, sucking the heads and getting what little meat there is out. They had bibs and I opted to not get one, I thought I was a big shot. I didn't have a nutcracker either. You can tell some of the pros in the restaurant, they brought their own. But the shell was soft enough to bend and snap the claws (tip, snap towards the front of the bag, or rice bowl). The head can be scary to eat, there's cartilage and bits and things that I was used to having in a soup, hence the rice. It was a bed I let everything drip onto. People complain about how small they are, but you WANT that, the smaller ones growing have more flavor, just like peppers. You don't want a large or genetically engineered huge crawfish.\n\nThis is where it gets personal. To be honest with you, I haven't had crawdads in years since I worked at the Orleans buffet. But that was once and part of a larger meal. Before that, it was decades. I had a rush of all kinds of family situations and get togethers and people attacking crawdads. It's not like shrimp, there's a lot more savage carnivorous behavior in eating crawfish. I felt like I took the easy route with all the shrimp cocktail and larger crustaceans I've had in town.  And there were a lot more memories than I was prepared for.\n\nI made the mistake of reading some of the others reviews. Their complaints seem to be about places outside of the valley which I disregard. Everyone knows the south has better crawfish, \"...everything is trucked into Vegas.\" But IN the valley, there's nothing like it.\n\nI had about a quarter pound left to go for later, paid my tab. They have tee shirts there, which is nice. There's no greater advertisement I think than the local's place tee shirt. \"Everything okay?\" \"Everything was fine, just a little spicy, baby doll\" I lied. My eyes were red and teary from 25 years plus dormant memories.","useful":4}

The bookends, before I used it to get to work and after are brief. I tried making some cool unchronological way to mix this up, but you've seen that all in the movies. \n\nThe monorail started out as a casino \"tram\" that linked MGM Grand to Bally's. This was back when I was a vacationer. I don't remember ever seeing it back then, although I have been thru that hall to the MGM parking. I just don't remember seeing it in any capacity. And I was at times, sober on the strip. \n\nThe first time I started using the monorail regularly was when I had a job on the strip and I lived off Sahara. I'd take the deuce to Sahara station and catch the monorail to work. Cool thing is, locals get a ride for a dollar, but you have to go to the booth to buy your tickets. There used to be booths- open- at every station, but with the recession they closed all but the ones at the ends of the line, Sahara and MGM Grand. So it's a hassle if you get to the strip on a bus line that goes to the middle of the strip. And you can only buy 2 at a time, one to get back. If they sold you any more, you'd turn around and sell them to tourists that pay $5 a ride. for tourists, the strip deuce is a better deal. And for things like using it to get downtown, Outlet mall or Town Square, Max bus would be the best. \n\nWhen locals buy in the booth, they write your info, including driver's license number. That always weird-ed me out, where those papers wound up. It's like the hundreds of applications I filled out. I don't like my personal info being out there to all those companies when they don't even talk to me when I'm there to acknowledge the effort I made to get down there. I don't understand why a manager wouldn't want to talk to someone who wants to be there, but they'll hang out with a dozen people in the back room that doesn't. After a month of applying I started to believe no one had any intention of hiring, all those applications went to their corporate market research think tanks that also come up with all those psychometric questions for applicants. \n\nI have been on the monorail thousands of times. I know when it's crowded on the strip by how much overflow gets to the monorail. People usually ride the deuce on the strip, which would actually cost more for my purposes, single ride, or a 24 hour pass. I've done the math every way. I have had a car to myself many of the times, almost half I'd say. I have been on the monorail totally drunk, or hungover in the morning. Every once in awhile in a coffee shop or somewhere, I see a picture of a guy riding in a subway train or bus in bright morning sunlight and his suit is all jacked up and he's a wreck from the night before. I have been that guy many times, I always look carefully to see if it's me in the artwork.\n\nI would usually ate my breakfast sandwich on the way to work. At the stations they had soda machines sponsored by Monster energy drink that may not be sponsoring it anymore. When I rode after those late nights, I started drinking them, they were $2 from the machine, at 7-11 they were more. I organized a couple of times to get them by the case at smart and final before I realized I was developing something of an addiction to something trashing my body with HFCS and sugar. \n\nOccasionally, you may see a security dog escorted with patrol. New Years is cool, the police often commandeer a car for their units with their K-9's. \n\nthey used to have cute monorail girls hand out pamphlets along the strip. Their costumes were designed to be 50's vintage, which was nice. \n\nThe rail system travels along \"the back\" of the casinos. Tourists roaming the strip may see this as a hassle. But I enjoyed being away from the crowds and I like the views. you can see swimming pools of the casinos it passes, a lot of Paradise Road and because a casino mogul didn't play nice, you get to ride around a golf course and to the Hilton before arriving at Sahara. I don't understand the golf course, that land would seem to make a lot more money with a Central Park type environment with bike rentals, walking paths, shops, maybe a zoo. Guess I think too much like a 2-3 dollar sign customer. \n\nI read the monorail may be closing 6 months from this writing if they don't come up with a backer. the problem was, the first leg SHOULD have been built to the airport, it would have paid for it to go all the way to Fremont Street by now, with the recession. But concessions had to be made to accommodate the taxi long haulers. BTW, all locals should tell you to NOT go thru a tunnel catching a cab from the airport. Drivers will lie and say there's construction or some BS, you have to be adamant before you get in the cab that Paradise is the way you'll be going, not the freeway.","useful":7}

It's huge and lines weren't long, so I can't complain about that, there were just tons of people (both patrons and employees) everywhere you turned.  I didn't love the layout either...\n\nI'm usually all about fast casual concepts and ordering at a window, but I hated that there are three different areas to pick up your food.  It varies depending on if you order salads, hot food, and/or dessert.  And you have to wait for your number to be called and then go pick it up from the appropriate window.  It's hard enough to hear your number being called and then it's tough because you have to leave your group to go get your food; hence, not a relaxing start to a meal...\n\nAmongst my group of three, we had a hotdog, a chicken sandwich (the breaded one on the croissant), a bowl of chilli, a barbecue chicken salad, and two large fries (one with cheese and one without).

When I worked on the strip, my office was given information slips to hand out to those who asked. Not only did they do some serious sinning, but were actually regretful about it and wanted to get to a church ASAP. \n\nNow, I'm an atheist for a few simple reasons, one is just inconsistencies that are in their own texts and practices. George Carlin covered most of it. War is the second reason. I imagine we'd be overpopulated and resources spent a few generations earlier if all the people lived without holy wars. \n\nAlso, I think one should believe in one's self. It's something I have caught myself not doing before. I'm even consistent with my beliefs in my darkest hours. I have heard it's a cheat or a loophole, because whatever creator there is, is in me, right? Perhaps, but I get to live by my own code of honor. Even in motorcycle accidents, I survived several somehow, without praying.\n\nRemember the Las Vegas show on NBC? There were many computer generated images of the Montecito on the strip.

Who went to bed with someone while their spouse was back home? What was big enough to go to church for?\n\nI went for inspiration, but not in the traditional sense. I had to observe people. I didn't have to worry about helping anyone here, that's what the church was for. I was free to observe, think and analyze, which is not critiquing. I'm still respectful. I didn't go to judge. I had questions, I wanted to go where people had a chance of finding answers. I listened to the service. I talked with a few people, small talk. \n\nWhatever each of those people did, the left with more comfort, perhaps felt forgiveness. I went with problems I couldn't figure out. Going to church was a way I could think of to be near the Strip, yet leave it in some kinda mental cushion, so I could think. \n\nIt helped.","useful":5}

On The Side Below?\n\nGoing in here was a purely fact finding, prime directivey type mission. I had to observe, I even put my shades on at night.\n \nI have seen the flow chart of alcohol questions to clerks on the strip faar too many times. It goes like this: \"Is there any store we can buy booze like the way we do back home?\" (It's called buying package liquor.)\n\n\"What about-\" \"no, casino shops are too expensive.\" \"Well then-\" \"We don't want to gamble to get one.\" \"Well, there's-\" \"We want booze cheaper than a casino bar.\"\n\nAnd then there's Walgreen's, recently gaining another location on the strip every few months, to go for their cut of casino booze business. \"But they're more expensive than back home?! Or even off-Strip locations!\" \n\nYes, they are. Your liquor store back home sits on a piece of land whose entire county isn't as valuable as a retail space on the Las Vegas Strip. And this mother's a duplex! This is what you have to pay if you didn't plan front loading a cooler for your vehicle or room before you went to the Strip. \n\nBelieve it or not, the messenger is often verbally berated as so many exit ports of mammals, instead of their CEO preying on casino guests, or casinos themselves being the \"chosen predators\" of their patrons. Comes with the territory of The Strip I say. A bottle of water is $3, just like a beer off strip not even 2 miles away. Locals be all front loading! Yes. All you gotta do is plan a little. \n\nI checked out the register staff, there were no people stocking. So I went to my browsing, to see what they had. If you know me, you know my love hate relationship with this chain. If not, it's best told over drinks with pieces of fruit skewered by novelty swordpicks. \n\nThe store was busy and in disarray when I was there. They arrange the checkout lines that Fry's Electronics made popular. Retail had sex with a bank by the dumpster and spawned this type of line. It does herd cattle thru a lot faster. And nothing puts me in a red seeing rage like watching a long line progress faster than the 1 person in front of us style check outs.\n\nFor a pharmacy, there are a few new novelties they're trying out. I know that the busiest locations in the chain are in fact those on The Strip, so they get all the flagship-y experimental frills. This location has a walk in beer/ wine cooler that's pretty coo. They also have a bartender type information screen, so you can find out what's in a drink or what you can make with their (not necessarily in stock) selection. \n\nThey do have one thing that tugs at my nostalgia strings: Icees! I grew up on Icee Bear, saving all the coupons to get logo stuff in the mail. Most of their locations disappeared with K-Marts. To me, I can always count on those in Walgs as much as the ice cream @ Thrifty's.\n\nThey got all the basics that may in fact still cheaper than Strip casino stores. Definitely a bigger selection in a pinch. People debate this chain with CVS. Basically, it all boils down to what we're closest to when we need birth con- uh, sundries. Every pharmacy on the strip has the same problems from what I've seen, for over a decade. Personally, given a choice I actually prefer ABC over both. They have a cooler (Hawaiian influenced) selection in most categories. \n\nI saw what I needed to see. I didn't find who I was looking for, so I was off to Twin Boobs. Uh perkys. Uh, Titty Peaks. Uh. To get a beer. More expensively. In the week I went, I got 2 of the best news I had in years. Surprisingly it was not from a busty bartender, but another customer..","useful":1}

Most department stores have a very limited stock and Target doesn't even sell them until January.  #2 - bathing suit shopping is never fun especially during holiday season when workouts get cut short and holiday parties with endless amounts of food and drinks replace them.\n\nSo, I was on a mission to find a new bathing suit for an upcoming vacation and I was not looking forward to it.  A friend of mine suggested 'Exquisite Swimwear' so I decided to check it out.  I'd seen the cute bathing suits in the window before but this was my first time going in.\n\nI received a warm welcome when I entered the store and later learned that the owner (Pauline) was who it came from.  I looked around on my own first and admired all the cute suits, accessories, cover ups, and more... then I felt a bit overwhelmed so I asked for her help.  When I told Pauline what styles and colors I prefer, she pulled a bunch of suits for me to try on... I narrowed it down to two suits and she was very honest in telling me which one she liked better.  (I hate it when you are shopping and the person helping you is not honest!)\n\nNeedless to say, I walked out with a new suit, so it was a productive trip... I was impressed with the store, the selection, and even the fact that in the dressing rooms, they offer disposable panties to try on suits with... of course the suits have hygienic liners as well, but this was an added bonus.  I was tempted by the clothing, headbands, sandals, and more, but I was on a mission for a bathing suit, so that's what I got!\n\nI totally recommend Exquisite Swimwear to anyone looking for a new bathing suit.  It's a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for... designer, good quality swimwear, great selection, and service too.  As I said before, bathing suit shopping is not fun for most of us, but Pauline made it a very pleasant experience for me.

The game we attended began at 1:10 p.m. but people were lined up outside on the sidewalks at literally 10:30 a.m. - they won't even let you in until two hours before a game!  \n\nThe roof is open often and it's really cool to see it close if you happen to be around for that.  If you stay in a stadium-view room, you can see all of the pre- and post-game happenings, which are actually super weird (like rehearsals for later pre-game stuff, cleaning, etc.).  \n\nParking can be difficult since there's only one official underground lot and that's shared with the hotel.  It filled on a Saturday by 11 a.m. so get there early if you want to park.  There's other public lots around the ballpark but they're a few blocks walk.","useful":1}

My steak was cooked perfectly and had the softest texture of any steak I have ever had. There was a quail egg and mushroom ravioli on top of the steak, which was very delicious, yet surprising because the quail egg yolk bursts in your mouth. I think my favorite part of the dish was the crispy parsnip chips that were perched on top like a flower! I tasted the rabbit two ways, which was even better than mine. The flavors were very complex, so we left satisfied.\n\nThe service was overall good and the waiter was nice, but I must say he was one of the most awkward servers I have had in a long time. He really did not know how to talk to us. When wine was ordered he could barely ask for an ID. We are  21, we look young, you should not be afraid to ask us for our ID, since it's part of the job. He also seemed to give us different service than the older patrons.

They do a great job of keeping on top of the folding and sorting and it shows.\n\nRW&Co also has really nice jewellery, belts and scarves and they're really affordable. I picked up a super soft wool scarf on sale for $10 and they often have things like strapless party dresses and trenchcoats on mega reduction. \n\nThere's also a men's section that I've never paid much attention to, but it's buffered by a spacious sitting area that's presumably reserved for boyfriends who are waiting for their ladies to finish in the fitting rooms. \n\nSpeaking of fitting rooms - they're MASSIVE. There is no limit or fussing as to how many items you can take with you and you're given absolute privacy while you're trying on the clothes. No salespeople nagging about correct sizing or rushing you out the door. There are multiple floor length mirrors and a long corridor for you to strut down while wearing your new outfits. Always a pleasant experience!","useful":0}

For instance, the wings at the Scottsdale and Thomas location are different from the wings you'll get at the Two Hippies location which are also different from the ones you get at my regular spot, and the one I'm going to talk about; the Stapley and 60 restaurant located next to the giant laser tag arena.  If you're thinking that maybe I've eaten Long Wong's wings and then played laser tag, you'd be right, I did, and it was awesome.\n\nThis location is cleaner and larger than most, and though it doesn't have the Ms. Pac Man game like the Scottsdale and Thomas location, it does have flames painted on the walls and flat screen TV's which are almost always tuned to Fox News or some sporting event I don't care about. \n\nAnother thing that has always intrigued be about this location is the walls.  The high walls are covered, mural style, with flames and boxers.  Yes, giant poorly painted flames and then black dudes boxing each other.  Why?  I don't know, and neither will you.\n\nSometimes my comrad and I will eat in, taking advantage of the beer special which are 2 dollar draft beers, all day, everyday which, by all accounts, wouldn't necessarily make it a \"special\" despite what the signs will tell you.  Long Wong's is really about the wings.  Most days I come in there is a line of people, all of them ordering wings, dozens, buckets, family packs, tearing at the bones, contemplating which flavor to get, licking their fingers.  I've only tried a few things off the Long Wong's menu: the wings, the fries, the hot dogs, and the burgers.  Seemingly there is a lot of other shit on the menu.  That's not important to me, the wings are the only worthwhile thing as most of the other items are reminiscent of slightly higher quality fast food with lettuce that is usually wilted.  Long Wong's carries a variety of wing flavors; teriyaki, asian garlic, Cajun, mild, medium, hot, suicide and my flavor of choice: SUPER suicide.  I think there are more.  I don't even know if \"asian garlic\" is really on the menu but it seems like it would be.\n\nThe thing about Long Wong's wings is that grabs me is that they're mostly heat.  It's not the flavor I love, it's the back of your throat, back of your tongue, lip burning heat.   I'm a sucker for the heat or anything that make me cry (like my life).  They serve the wings with Ranch, not Blue Cheese which seems more appropriate for these wings anyway.  The Ranch is good there too, not over done or spiced up by something, just a thin, normal, restaurant Ranch which they don't charge you for like some places.\n\nThey are horribly liberal with the sauce, dousing your order of plump wings in a thick, orange sauce touched slightly with chili seeds.  These are, by far, the sauciest wings I've had.\n\nAfter each bite of a Long Wong's wings it looks like you killed a bunny or some other small, cute animal with your bare hand.  The sauce gets under your fingernails and the burn stays on your hands even after a run under water.  You must scrub, with soap, to rid your skin of that unique wing smell and the stain of the orange sauce.  Don't do anything sexual after eating Long Wong's wings for at least 12 hours.\n\nThere is one thing about this location which I go to that, for some reason, always seems to put a damper on my wing eating, beer drinking frenzy.  That is the grey, mustached owner who always seems to be annoyed by all the service he's getting.  I imagine this guy to be the owner based on assumption and his naturally ownery vibe.  \n\nLong Wong's on Stapley and 60, despite the Angry Successful Business Owner, is one of my favorite Mesa spots and is a true testament to what good, true take out wings SHOULD be.  Even if you don't like them hot you can appreciate the honey bbqs or the Arizona chili flavor or even the blue cheese ones.  Plus, a 7.99 combo that gives you a dozen wings, fries and drink is, like, super reasonable especially considering the quality.  I have grown fond of the new, exciting fliers placed up periodically in an attempt, I assume, by the Angry Successful Business Owner to become even MORE successful, thus more angry.  Lately I've noticed they're doing karaoke on Friday nights and 25 cent wings on Tuesdays.  Long Wongs has helped me come out of the closet as a wing enthusiast so no longer will I hide my bones in my top nightstand drawer.  I will proudly leave them chewed and dried up for all the world to see and get grossed out by.","useful":5}

I also found it quite curious that the average customer age was 16-20 - I thought to myself, \"how the hell do these teens afford the clothes here\" till I saw Moms pop up around the corner with credit cards in hand. Mystery solved.\n\nI take offense to the communal fitting rooms - there are no mirrors in the stalls so if you want to see how well the clothes fit (or rather, don't fit, if you're bigger than a size 6), you have to exit to the common area and view yourself in the large mirror. I managed to avoid this by wedging a makeup mirror into the groove between two hooks and stepping back - I was able to get a pretty good look at myself that way.\n\nAlso, the managers here need to invest in walkie talkie technology. IMO yelling and barking orders from across the length of the store isn't an efficient way to communicate with your staff. The sales associates here looked quite frazzled, but they were helpful despite the chaos on a Saturday.","useful":7}

No matter what your schedule is, you can find a class that works for you.  I've never had a bad experience with any class at At One.  I like the flow classes best, but every now and then, I'll challenge myself with a power class or I'll go back to the basics with Carlos or Sara B.'s intro classes.

(www.yeahdaveyoga.com)\n\nSo, yes, classes are on the pricey side at anywhere from $13 - $25 per class depending on the package you purchase, but in return, you are doing something so positive for your physical and mental health, it is worth it!\n\nWhat else can I share about At One Yoga?  The studios are clean and the music played in each class always gets me going and helps to get me into the present moment.  The employees are friendly and helpful and the boutique offers some really cool yoga apparel and gifts.\n\nAs a final note, I will share something that I learned from Sara B. in her New Year's Day flow class:  2008 is a '1' year.  (If you add up the digits in 2008, you get 10 and then add those and you get 1).  It is a year for new beginnings.

This is not cafeteria counter panini - these are gourmet delights created and assembled with care. I find it impossible to tear myself away from the Italian tuna, hard-boiled egg and caper panini because it's such a perfect, carefully thought out combination of flavours. It was at Negroni that I first discovered my love for fennel - each panini comes with a side salad of arugula, shaved fennel and fresh sheets of parmagiano reggiano, with a dollop of Israeli couscous, cannellini beans and olives. Really inventive pairing here. I've also sampled the dessert panini, which is less overwhelming than you think, so don't hesitate to cap off your meal with it. Fresh strawberries, nutella, mascarpone cheese and confectioner's sugar...how, pray tell, can you go wrong?? Lest you think I was satisfied with sampling only one dessert, I can promise you that the rotation of homemade ice creams is also rock solid - I've tried peanut butter as well as chocolate and they're heavenly.\n\nMusic is a delight - hand selected by the chefs themselves and including selections from Radiohead, Junior Boys, Yeasayer and the like. Everyone that works here seems to be truly happy.

Efforts like that really instill trust and I appreciated it.  The Sales side of things was a 5* experience and we've been happy with our purchase.  \n\nThe delivery was about a 3*, annoying but we dealt with it. It started with a estimated delivery window of 4-6pm.  The driver then called the Mister at about 2pm that day and said they'd be about an hour early so told him to be home at 3pm.  The Mister rushed home and waited. So, you would expect them to be there at 3pm, after asking someone to hurry home, right?!  Nope. They pulled up at maybe 5:30pm.  Good grief. Once they got there, they were perfectly pleasant, efficient and got the bed up the stairs and in place before we even knew it. However, having someone rush home because you tell them you're going to be early and then not show up until late... not cool. \n\nAll in all, I think Sears is a great place to buy a mattress, just don't hold out too much hope for the delivery going seamlessly (which seems to be par for the course everywhere, it seems).","useful":3}

There was a Taco Bell located right across the street from BHS (my high school), and if memory serves, the drive-thru was open pretty damn late; maybe even 24 hours?!  At the time, my friends and I made many a \"run for the border,\" and I remember the food being great!\n\nEither I was really drunk back then or Taco Bell has gone down hill or my taste buds have matured quite a bit since then, because after eating Taco Bell for dinner last night, I no longer \"quiero Taco Bell.\"  Or maybe I ordered wrong?\n\nI'm quite nauseous thinking about what I ordered (and ate) last night:\n-1 Mexican Pizza (540 calories / 30 grams of fat)\n-1 Chicken Soft Taco (180 calories / 6 grams of fat)\n-1 Pintos and Cheese (170 calories / 6 grams of fat)\n\nI didn't know there was a \"Drive-Thru Diet¬Æ Menu\" until looking at their website just now either... oh well, I'm eating for two right now!\n\nI also didn't realize the slogan changed to \"think outside the bun\" until actually listening to the radio commercials as I drove home with my food in my lap last night.    I will say that the drive-thru was super quick and my order was right and all for under $6.  What a bargain!\n\nI'm sure Taco Bell is still a great option when you're out late, have had a few too many, and/or are eating on a budget.  But I don't recommend it when you're completely sober and it's a normal hour.

Wowzers!  The downside is that the place is tiny - there's not really much room to wait in the restaurant or a bar to sit at.  The hostess asked for our phone number and politely advised that she would \"call when a table is ready\" which made me feel like we needed to leave and entertain ourselves for a spell.  The problem is the 20-25 minute wait isn't quite long enough to go somewhere else, get a beer, drink it, wondering when you're going to get a call and feel like you have to chug it down to get back there asap (since it's not like you're in the same place and can simply carry it back to your table).  Reservations are only accepted for groups of four or more and our waitress advised calling at least a day in advance. \n\nOnward and upward.  The menu included several vegetarian rolls, which I appreciated. The prices were average for sushi in the area, if not a wee bit higher. This is the first restaurant I've found around with shitake rolls on the menu (my favorite) so I was thrilled!  Unfortunately (like many of their veg rolls here) it was to be served in tempura batter.  Noo!  Don't drown the shitake!!  Fortunately, I asked the waitress for a simple, basic, plain ol' shitake roll (minus the tempura) and the chef obliged.  The first order got messed up (dipped in tempura batter anyways) but our waitress noticed and brought a plain shitake roll next.  This was great because we got to compare - and the plain one was great, you really got to taste the shitake, in the tempura roll it was also rolled with avocado which, along with the batter, essentially overpowered the mushroom.  Plain is the way to go and I appreciated the accommodating service! \n\nBOTTOM LINE: Charming service and good shitake rolls means I'll go back - I'll just try to get there even earlier!","useful":1}

Noodles (brown rice, but who could tell?), carrots, chickpeas, green peas, potatoes, tomatoes, turmeric, cayenne and lots of fresh dill.\n\nAnother great thing about Camros is that all the ingredients for specials are listed next to the names so those with allergies, sensitivities or on detoxes can choose accordingly.\n\nI was left stuffed - but not uncomfortably so - for $9 including tax.\n\nOne final note - Camros is closed on weekends and is more of a lunch counter/walkup spot. Don't come here on a date or with a group of 20 people.","useful":10}

We were looking for an indoor play option to escape the heat, and that's exactly what we found!\n\nI didn't know much about it other than what I read on the Yelp reviews and website, and I'd say that what I read was pretty accurate.  We arrived around 10:30am and it wasn't too crowded.  My kids (3 and 4 years old) started running around and exploring as soon as we entered.  Note: before entering, you must sign a waiver and pay... I think it was less than $30 for the four of us to enter,; pretty reasonable.  \n\nThe kids found plenty to keep them busy, and we bumped into some other friends of ours while we were there.  Some of the play areas are for kids over 5 or a certain height, but they aren't monitored, so it's up to the parents to keep an eye on their kids, which some were doing / some were not.  \n\nI spent another $10 in games with the kids... skeeball, a wheel of fortune type game, one where you throw a ball at clowns to knock them down, etc... We got tickets and with those,  prizes (erasers, fake teeth, and candy).  Isn't it amazing how the cheapest junkiest little things can make kids so happy by the way?!\n\nWhen it started to get more crowded around noon, I'd had enough... We convinced the kids to leave after a small melt-down and headed out to nearby Pita Jungle for a quick lunch before we headed home.\n\nThis place is definitely A-OK - it won't blow you away as an adult, but it's a fun place for kids -- especially if you're looking to escape our crazy AZ summer heat!","useful":6}

Eggs, bacon, chicken, blue cheese, tomato. It just seems so excessive). \n\nWhat intrigued me most was the selection of three bennies, all starting with the letter B: Eggs Brunhilde (grilled asparagus, smoked salmon, horseradish), Eggs Bernadette (sauteed spinach, peameal bacon) and Eggs Beatrice (sauteed spinach, grilled tomato and swiss cheese). \n\nI ordered the Eggs Beatrice and it was GORGEOUS (see pics). There was no side order, just the benny itself, perched perfectly atop a bed of ever-so-slightly wilted spinach and a sizzling round hash brown patty. The hash brown provided the perfect amount of crunch to go with the oozy poached eggs. There was b√©arnaise sauce as well as hollandaise on the eggs, making it quite a decadent meal. \n\nService was super friendly and quick, plus our food took no time at all despite a fairly full house. OK OK has beautiful, old-school diner decor combined with fresh, dark wood trim. The place seats about 20 or 25 at the bar and in the half dozen vinyl-lined booths. There are tiny old black and white TVs along the shelving playing modern news and there's cute chalkboard art depicting combo menu in front of the stove. \n\nMinus one star for assuming I wanted freshly squeezed OJ (I really hate it when servers do this) when I ordered OJ ($4 vs. $2) and for the prices in general, which I found a bit on the expensive side.

The Phoenix likes to maintain a line even after the doors have opened, so let's say you want to show up for opener at 9pm - there'll be a line of people arriving in time for the headliner and you will completely miss the opener because you're standing in line like a chump. \n\nGETTING CARDED:\nYour ID will be checked and so will your bags so make sure you don't have anything fishy in there - although it's not a thorough job like the strip searches The Opera House is known for. Also, I was once asked my age instead of to show ID and I actually LIED ABOUT MY AGE SAYING I WAS YOUNGER THAN I WAS (but still older than 19). Why did I do this!? I have no idea. I got nervous.\n\nCOAT CHECK: \nDon't do it. \n\nGETTING INEBRIATED:\nThere are FIVE bars at The Phoenix. One as soon as you come in on the left (hardly ever busy), one at the back, a really long one on the right side and one upstairs. Take your pick but by no means should you feel limited by bars or have long wait times here. Keep traffic moving. \n\nALL AGES SHOWS: \nIncredibly annoying at The Phoenix. You'll be asked for ID at the door and once again when entering the back part where the bars are to get a wristband - the front of the area is cordoned off and you won't be able to move close to the stage with your alcoholic beverage so make a decision - do you want to drink, or do you want to be up front?\n\nRELIEVING YOURSELF (ladies only): \nBet you didn't know there were two washrooms. One in the basement by the back of the bar, and one near the coat check. It looks like a room that's not in use but it's a perfectly good washroom.\n\nEARPLUGS: \nBring them. You will need them. The sound quality will rock your world. Bands sound different from the main floor compared to the upper level so try both to see which you prefer.\n\nEXITING:\nDon't be a fool and leave the same way you came in - make a beeline for the back exit double doors by the men's washroom on the right. You'll bypass the winding corridor line and about a thousand other people and go straight outside. Voila!","useful":48}

We arrived to a full house on Saturday evening and settled onto some stools at the bar to enjoy a beer before a table was ready for us.  The bar selection was good and the bartender was enthusiastic and welcoming.\n\nBuilt within an old house, The Spot is small; there were only about 10 tables and about 4-6 spots at the bar.  Rumor has it there is some outdoor seating but it was a bit too chilly to take advantage of that!  They aren't currently taking reservations but who knows if that will change down the road.  The ambiance is quite nice; freshly done woodwork, soft lighting, and lined with black & white photos on the dark red walls.  If I had my choice, the best seats in the house are probably in the bar area or the booths up by the front windows.  Two of the booths are right by the kitchen window which has pros and cons; some people love \"seeing behind the curtain\" and watching the action.  I, on the other hand, find fluorescent kitchen lights to be my kryptonite so I'd rather stick to the more romantic corners of the space.\n\nThe menu had many tempting options on it for both the vegetarian and the carnivore. Prices were reasonable and a lot sounded tasty.  We started with the Baked Artichoke Remikin ($6.50) which was served with pickled carrots and crusty bread.  We enjoyed it thoroughly; it was a good portion for two or three.  For entrees I had the Portabella stew ($11) which I enjoyed and the Mister settled on the Wild Boar Sausage ($14) and was also pleased.  Portions were fair sized, enough for dinner for each of us, not really enough to take home for lunch the next day.  Both entrees were served with a side of cooked greens and polenta.  The greens were good, the polenta was so salty even Mr.-High-Blood-Pressure himself wasn't interested.  \n\nThis is where The Spot's interest in customer service became evident: our server noticed both of us were bypassing the polenta & asked for feedback, which we provided.  He did say the kitchen team is still tweaking things and trying to improve everything, of course, so they appreciate hearing customer's thoughts on the food. (Well, you know we're not shy!).  We provided feedback on the polenta but assured him that overall they seem to be in great shape.  A few minutes later, the owner offered us a complimentary dessert due to the polentapalooza.  Yum!  Dense chocolate cake, rich and sweet, a perfect end to the meal.\n\nI liked the cozy space, it looks like they'll have some fun specials during the week, there were several things that tempted me on the menu, parking was easy, prices were reasonable, service was great... all in all, we look forward to heading back again.","useful":6}

At 7pm on a Friday the place was slammed with customers but even without a reservation (yes, you can make reservations here) I didn't have to wait long. I got veggies and dip as I mulled over what to order, and decided on the salmon burger with goat cheese and avocado. Our experience was decent but the burger not really memorable. The fries and sweet potato fries both remained virtually untouched, which is somewhat telling as I am a french fry FIEND. Needs improvement, although the next day when I returned, some repeat customers raved that the fries had improved since day one, so it looks like they're on their way to perfecting the process.\n\nThe second, for Vivek S's surprise birthday party the next day, was nearly flawless. Our server, Marianne, was efficient and warm towards our colossal group of rabblerousers (and I needn't mention that she was also gorgeous). There were at least thirty of us monopolizing the entire back area of the restaurant and she and her stone-faced co-server (who I'm sure would be pretty if she would crack a smile once in a while?) handled our orders like champs. Food came out swiftly and no one was left waiting while the others ate - I was really impressed with how this was handled. Drinks also came quickly and without any flagging down.\n\nMy grilled cheese with egg and tomato.\n\nGET IT. \n\nThe fluffy sourdough bread was lightly toasted the way I like it, and the cheese within oozed out and complemented the fried egg and tomatoes nicely. This is seriously one of my new favourite flavour combinations and I would come back anytime to order this sandwich. \n\nHere's what sealed the deal: at the end of the night when we went to wrap it up, we received separate bills without any fuss or even having to ask. Phenomenal. \n\nOther than the french fries and some of the tables near the front being too close together/in the way, W Burger has got it goin' on. It's consistently busy with good reason: cheap drinks, good food and a boisterous atmosphere. The bathrooms are also very clean and well appointed. \n\nTIP: Don't come here for a date on a Friday or Saturday night (it's very noisy), but any other time would be perfectly fine.

Finally I caught up with him and tried to hand him the flyers, saying they'd be going to waste as I'd just throw them out. He refused to take them back and said \"It's called marketing, b*tch!\" and kept walking.\n\nNow I don't know about you, but I'm more than aware of what marketing is. I've even flyered in the past, and the most simple rules apply: either leave a pile of flyers for people to take of their own volition or offer them to people but in no way should you ever FORCE someone to take your flyer. Or assault a group of people with your flyers, which is what this guy did. \n\nIn an era where 100% of mailboxes bear a plea for \"no junk mail\" and companies are scrambling to offer their customers paperless billing, it's absolutely mind-numbing that a company would so blatantly want to litter the city with its flyers and aggravate people in the process. It's a shame that Suite 106 & Wet Bar chose someone who clearly failed Marketing 101 and lacks any professionalism to represent their business. \n\nWhat ever happened to TALKING to a person about your product or business?

My experience with hospitals growing up was always to visit friends or relatives that were sick or recovering from accidents, and I've never felt 100% comfortable at the site of blood, dealing with disease, or \"scary\" situations.  For these reasons, I really respect doctors, nurses, and all of the staff that work at hospitals to help those in need on a daily basis.\n\nAll of that being said, I've seen my fair share of emergency rooms in the last few years, and for the most part, I've had decent experiences, even as the patient.  I've actually been to this Scottsdale Healthcare location three times already in the past eight months: twice for scares with the pregnancy and once for a breastfeeding class.  This is the hospital where my OB/GYN delivers, so naturally, this is where I'll be heading when Baby Mess is ready to enter the world... and I'm confident that I'll be in good hands when the time comes!\n\nI've heard great things about the facility itself, especially the labor/delivery area, from other friends that have delivered here.  And from my experience to date, the staff has always been great as well.  Parking can be tricky, but they do offer complimentary parking during the week... and the breastfeeding class I took was very informative.\n\nBottom line: I don't think any hospital will ever be at the top of my list of \"fun places to hang-out,\" but if you or someone you know is in a situation where medical help / a hospital is needed, you can't go wrong with Scottsdale Healthcare.  Fingers crossed, I'll still feel this same way after I deliver this baby!","useful":7}

A lot of their CDs are sorted by record label grouping - so for the smaller labels that have a really particular audience you can browse by genre. Arts & Crafts, Domino, Fat Cat, Merge, Warp Records, etc. It's a fun way to shop for new music if you want to hear more from a label family.\n\n2. Biographies. Soundscapes has a ridiculously large selection of music biographies and music history books. You can find so many cool bios here beyond the usual Bob Dylan or R.E.M. book (why ARE there so many bios about these two bands, by the way?). There are books about every genre and era in music history.\n\n3. DVDs. There isn't a music-related DVD that you won't be able to find (or at the very least, order) at Soundscapes. They have music video DVDs, biopics and live concert footage DVDs. I bought a really good Glastonbury DVD here that I had been digging around for for a long tome and I found it here.\n\nThe staff isn't over friendly or helpful but they're not dicks either, and when I'm shopping for music that's all I really care about - that I'm left alone and not judged silently (or openly for that matter!) about what I'm looking at.","useful":3}

Julie who answered the phone was really sweet (always a good sign), and Matt, our server, was extremely personable and attentive.  We had a group of 8 - including a few picky eaters.  We started with chips (which are house-made) and salsa, guacamole, and grilled shrimp & guacamole tostada bites... On top of that, the GM brought us over the beef tostadas and shrimp & pork dumplings - this was a very sweet gesture and much appreciated - we finished every last bite of both!

The beef tostadas were yummy also; I think these are both new menu items that are being tested - hopefully they will stay since they were both pretty impressive!\n\nAfter sampling all of that, I still somehow managed to eat my dinner salad with a light lime vinagrette dressing; it was good but nothing special.

Produced by Neil Simon, this show explores the thin line between love and hate!  I was told that the story line came from a movie in the '70s, supposedly Robert Redford and Jane Fonda starred in it.  I'll have to rent it now!\n\nA few other comments:\n - I didn't have to wait in line for the bathroom and I went twice!  (it was clean too!)\n- I didn't have to wait in line for concessions at intermission and the markup was small... only $1 for a bottle of water!\n- friendly people everywhere including after the show when the cast greets you as you leave...\n\nI'll for sure be back to Desert Stages for upcoming productions - if you like intimate theatre, go check it out!  This specific show is playing through July 6th!","useful":8}

A few minutes later, I found myself on the table with a comfy blanket getting the dermaplane followed by the hydrafacial.  Evonne was friendly and professional and used extreme care as she did everything and explained what she was doing along the way.\n\nWhile I tend to prefer more pampering spa-like experiences, this was obviously more of a medi-spa experience and a deeper clean than anything I've had before.

I had one of my favorite lunches - the chopped vegetable salad, no pistachios, add shrimp, a whole wheat tortilla on the side, and a large Arnold Palmer.  All was delicious as expected and delivered with friendly service.  This location is clean, spacious, has indoor and outdoor seating, and plenty of parking.\n\nWhether you go with my order above or anything else on the menu, you really can't go wrong.  From the sandwiches, bowls, juices, smoothies, baked goods, and more - everything I've ever had from OCS is delicious!  I've used them for catering orders as well.  \n\nEven with their rapid growth (currently at 8 Valley locations + 4 in TX), Original Chop Shop has managed to keep their menu and quality consistent, which is no small feat.  I hope it continues as I'm a huge fan of this fast casual, healthy concept.  Congrats to all involved!","useful":12}

This review is solely an update about the current clusterf**k of a situation that is the detour in the east end between York and Broadview. Heretofore referred to as The Great Detour Of 2009‚Ñ¢. \n\nWhat was once just a long straight ride across the city has become an awful, gut-wrenching series of turns and delays, not to mention confusion across the board. It's brutal.\n\nBank on adding between 30 and 45 minutes to your trip for the detour. It hasn't been standard on any of my trips and is different going east or west on Queen. Today the streetcar turned so many freaking times in a span of 10 minutes that when I looked up I actually had no clue where I was or which orientation we were facing. On certain trips there is a dude (like, an actual person) standing in the intersection waiting for the streetcar to pass because it comes off the rails so often due to the turn - around York/Richmond this happens. That's the guy's job - to reattach the streetcar cable.\n\nI should point out that the most disappointing part of this all is the radio silence from the driver. There should be regular updates (even if they're recorded) reminding people that the streetcar is detouring and what the names of the new stops are. What was once Queen & Church is now Richmond and Church and at one point we were on King Street and then later Dundas. No one on the streetcar knew where we were going and people kept getting up to ask where we were. Talk about directional mayhem!","useful":8}

This was seriously the worst eggs florentine I've ever had, and in opposition, I *LOVED* the home fries. \n\nAnd now, a little culinary lesson. As you may know, Hollandaise is one of the \"mother sauces\" and is an emulsion of butter and egg yolks, seasoned with lemon juice. The Hollandaise here was indeed velvety and smooth, but the flavour was awful. Either it was from a packet or the cook that day failed culinary school, because there was NO lemon flavour nor much egg yolk - it was mostly melted butter. Needless to say it was unappealing. There was way too much spinach and it was sogging all over the English muffins, rendering them inedible. As a final coup de gr√¢ce, the eggs were poached soft, but because they evidently weren't fresh, the whites weren't tight. They were loose and watery and even after wiping away the \"Hollandaise\" I wasn't in the mood to eat them. \n\nThe menu is hilarious. It's printed on a 8 1/2 x 14 folded sheet of paper. Times New Roman font, and a clipart train blown up to 400%. Clipart train = chew chew. Get it?? \n\nPrices are decent and the service was wonderful.

The place is teeming with elderly Ukrainians and at least in my family's experience, the name St. Joe's comes up immediately when you start to tackle the topic of palliative care. I've personally seen a few people wither in this very hospital, but if you've gotta take your last breath somewhere, it may as well be St. Joe's - it's trumps!\n\nI've been here more times than I care to recall - there was the Butternut Squash Incident‚Ñ¢ of 2006 (I'm still missing feeling in my thumb, seriously), The Mandoline Mishap‚Ñ¢ of 2007, a bout with whooping cough (again, not joking), a SARS scare and various other visits for fancy tests. If you have to get any sort of blood work, ultrasounds or specialist followup work done, ask your doctor if you can have it done at St. Joe's.

Where could I find an unhealthy meal? This should not be to hard I have many choices. Ah! a steakhouse is a good start. \n\nI knew I was off to a great start when I walked into the bar area to sit at a high table for two and I began breathing in a stream of second hand smoke. I looked over towards the bar to see who was assisting in my quest for an unhealthy meal. It was coming from a couple with matching bowling shirts at the end of the bar. She was blowing smoke like a broken radiator hose in a Mack truck. I am thinking this meal is going beyond unhealthy, it might kill me. \n\nThe service was slow even though the place was not crowded. I ordered a glass of Chateau Ste. Michelle, Indian Reserve Cabernet. \nThey actually poured a full 6 ounces in my glass.\n\nMy server finally showed up after a long wait and I ordered the large fillet and mushroom sides, knowing it would be prepared in lots of unhealthy butter. That is a Ruth Chris signature on steak preparation. Marinade it lots of butter and then pour more butter on top right before you serve it on an extremely hot plate. I was well on my way to having an unhealthy meal. \n\nThe steak arrived on the white plate heated to ??? degrees. The steak was standing in a pool of butter and additional butter was jumping off the edges of the plate due to the sizzling effect. The large mushrooms were glistening from the butter coating and almost floating in the butter. Man, I am really living on the edge! \n\nThe server warned me of the hot plate heated to ??? degrees and placed it 3\" from me on the table. I could feel the intense heat from the plate and I stared in amazement as the 200+ degree sizzling butter splattered onto my $125 shirt. I am now thinking not only will I eat unhealthy but I can trash one of my favorite shirts at the same time. \n\nI started in on the mushrooms and sure enough they tasted buttery. I liked the mushrooms, very tasty. The steak was cooked medium (pink in the center) and had a odd shape for a fillet. The steak tasted very average and actually had a few tough spots which is unusual for a center cut fillet. \n\nI finished up and felt that I had accomplished my goal of eating an unhealthy meal. I was all buttered up inside and out, thanks to the server putting the plate of spattering butter right next to me. My lungs were full of second hand smoke and I was on a red meat overdose. \n\nThis is just another corporate steakhouse environment. Hit or miss on the food quality and not in the same league as the Ruth Chris in Annapolis, Md. As I write this review I am soaking the shirt I wore the other night to Ruth Chris in Wisk laundry detergent in an attempt to get the butter stain out. I might write a review about Wisk.","useful":2}
